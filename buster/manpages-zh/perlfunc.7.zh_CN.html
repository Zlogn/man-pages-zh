这一章里的函数可以作为表达式来使用。
  Perl
  中的函数主要分为两类：数组运算符和命名的一元运算符。
  不同之处在于他们的优先级关系。(参阅
  perlop 中的优先级表 )
  数组运算符需要一个以上的参数，而一元运算符不能超过一个参数。
  因此，一个逗号将结束一个一元运算符,
  但对于数组运算符，只是起到分隔的作用。
  一元运算符一般只提供一个标量作为参数，而数组运算符可能会提供标量或者数组作为参数。
  如果二者都有，标量参数一般在前面，数组参数跟在后面。
  (注意，可以只有一个数组变量)
  例如, splice()
  有三个标量变量，后面加上一个数组,
  相反 gethostbyname()
  有四个标量变量。
<p class="Pp">在语法描述中,数组运算符需要一个用LIST标识的数组作为参数。
    这些
    数组可能由标量参数和数组值混合组成;
    数组值将包含在数组中，每个元素被插入数组中,
    形成一个更长一维的数组值。
    数组的元素应该用逗号分开。</p>
<p class="Pp">下面列出的任何函数可以在参数两边有括号，也可以没有。(语法描述中省略括号)
    如果你使用括号，一个简单的规则是
    (偶尔会令人吃惊):
    如果是函数,没有优先级的问题；如果它是一个数组运算符或者一元运算符
    那么就要考虑优先级。并且，函数两边的空白和
    &#34;（&#34;
    是不计算的－－因此，
    有时候需要小心行事。看看下面的几个例子：</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print 1+2+4;        # Prints 7.
    print(1+2) + 4;     # Prints 3.
    print (1+2)+4;      # Also prints 3!
    print +(1+2)+4;     # Prints 7.
    print ((1+2)+4);    # Prints 7.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">前面说得似乎有点抽象，那么你在运行PERL时带上-w开关你将得到一些
    警告信息，您可以根据这些信息再体会一下。例如，上面的例子会产生如下信息：</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print (...) interpreted as function at - line 1.
    Useless use of integer addition in void context at - line 1.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">有些函数根本不需要参数，因此工作方式和一元运算符和数组运算符都不同，
    <span class="Li">&#34;time&#34;</span> 和
    <span class="Li">&#34;endpwent&#34;</span>
    算是两个典型吧. 如,
    <span class="Li">&#34;time+86_400&#34;</span>
    实际上是 <span class="Li">&#34;time() +
    86_400&#34;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">对于可以用在标量或者数组的上下文中的函数,非失败性的错误在标量环境下
    通常暗示返回了未定义的值或在数组环境下返回一个空的数组。</p>
<p class="Pp">记住下面的重要原则：
    没有规则和数组环境下的表达式的行为和他的标量环境的行为有关系，反之亦然。
    这可能产生两种完全不同的情况。在标量环境下，每个运算符和函数决定怎样以最恰当的次序返回值。
    有些运算符在数组环境下返回数组的长度.，有些运算符返回的一个元素，有些返回数组中的最后一个元素，有些返回成功执行的操作的语句数。通常，他们返回一些你需要的值，除非你需要连续性。</p>
<p class="Pp">在标量环境下的命名数组在第一眼看上去时和在标量环境下的列表有很大的不同。
    在标量环境下，你不能得到一个像
    <span class="Li">&#34;(1,2,3)&#34;</span>
    的列表,因为在编译时，编译器是知道当前环境的，它将在那里产生标量的逗号运算符，
    而不是用于分隔数组元素的逗号.
    也就是说，它永远不会以一个数组开始。</p>
<p class="Pp">一般说来，
    PERL中的函数对应相应的系统调用
    (如<a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/chown.2.en.html">chown(2)</a>, <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/fork.2.en.html">fork(2)</a>, <i>closedir</i>(2),
    等等.)
    成功调用后返回真值，否则返回
    <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> ,
    下面将会提到。这一点和C的接口不一样，C中出错时将返回<span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span>
    .但是也有几个例外，他们是
    <span class="Li">&#34;wait&#34;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&#34;waitpid&#34;</span>, 和
    <span class="Li">&#34;syscall&#34;</span> 。
    系统调用出错时出错信息将通过特殊变量$!返回。其他的函数则不会，除非发生意外。

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>-X FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-X EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-X</dt>
  <dd>A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below. This unary
      operator takes one argument, either a filename or a filehandle, and tests
      the associated file to see if something is true about it. If the argument
      is omitted, tests <span class="Li">$_</span>, except for
      <span class="Li">&#34;-t&#34;</span>, which tests STDIN. Unless
      otherwise documented, it returns <span class="Li">1</span> for true and
      <span class="Li">&#39;&#39;</span> for false, or the undefined value if the file
      doesn&#39;t exist. Despite the funny names, precedence is the same as any
      other named unary operator, and the argument may be parenthesized like any
      other unary operator. The operator may be any of:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -r  File is readable by effective uid/gid.
    -w  File is writable by effective uid/gid.
    -x  File is executable by effective uid/gid.
    -o  File is owned by effective uid.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -R  File is readable by real uid/gid.
    -W  File is writable by real uid/gid.
    -X  File is executable by real uid/gid.
    -O  File is owned by real uid.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -e  File exists.
    -z  File has zero size (is empty).
    -s  File has nonzero size (returns size in bytes).
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -f  File is a plain file.
    -d  File is a directory.
    -l  File is a symbolic link.
    -p  File is a named pipe (FIFO), or Filehandle is a pipe.
    -S  File is a socket.
    -b  File is a block special file.
    -c  File is a character special file.
    -t  Filehandle is opened to a tty.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -u  File has setuid bit set.
    -g  File has setgid bit set.
    -k  File has sticky bit set.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -T  File is an ASCII text file (heuristic guess).
    -B  File is a &#34;binary&#34; file (opposite of -T).
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -M  Script start time minus file modification time, in days.
    -A  Same for access time.
    -C  Same for inode change time (Unix, may differ for other platforms)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        chomp;
        next unless -f $_;      # ignore specials
        #...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The interpretation of the file permission operators
        <span class="Li">&#34;-r&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;-R&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;-w&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;-W&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;-x&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;-X&#34;</span> is by default based solely on the
        mode of the file and the uids and gids of the user. There may be other
        reasons you can&#39;t actually read, write, or execute the file. Such
        reasons may be for example network filesystem access controls, ACLs
        (access control lists), read-only filesystems, and unrecognized
        executable formats.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also note that, for the superuser on the local filesystems,
        the <span class="Li">&#34;-r&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;-R&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;-w&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;-W&#34;</span> tests always return 1, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;-x&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;-X&#34;</span> return 1 if any execute bit is
        set in the mode. Scripts run by the superuser may thus need to do a
        <i>stat()</i> to determine the actual mode of the file, or temporarily
        set their effective uid to something else.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are using ACLs, there is a pragma called
        <span class="Li">&#34;filetest&#34;</span> that may produce more
        accurate results than the bare <i>stat()</i> mode bits. When under the
        <span class="Li">&#34;use filetest &#39;access&#39;&#34;</span> the
        above-mentioned filetests will test whether the permission can (not) be
        granted using the <i>access()</i> family of system calls. Also note that
        the <span class="Li">&#34;-x&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;-X&#34;</span> may under this pragma return true
        even if there are no execute permission bits set (nor any extra execute
        permission ACLs). This strangeness is due to the underlying system
        calls&#39; definitions. Read the documentation for the
        <span class="Li">&#34;filetest&#34;</span> pragma for more
        information.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&#34;-s/a/b/&#34;</span> does not
        do a negated substitution. Saying
        <span class="Li">&#34;-exp($foo)&#34;</span> still works as expected,
        however--only single letters following a minus are interpreted as file
        tests.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&#34;-T&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;-B&#34;</span> switches work as follows. The
        first block or so of the file is examined for odd characters such as
        strange control codes or characters with the high bit set. If too many
        strange characters (&gt;30%) are found, it&#39;s a
        <span class="Li">&#34;-B&#34;</span> file, otherwise it&#39;s a
        <span class="Li">&#34;-T&#34;</span> file. Also, any file containing
        null in the first block is considered a binary file. If
        <span class="Li">&#34;-T&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;-B&#34;</span> is used on a filehandle, the
        current IO buffer is examined rather than the first block. Both
        <span class="Li">&#34;-T&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;-B&#34;</span> return true on a null file, or a
        file at EOF when testing a filehandle. Because you have to read a file
        to do the <span class="Li">&#34;-T&#34;</span> test, on most occasions
        you want to use a <span class="Li">&#34;-f&#34;</span> against the
        file first, as in <span class="Li">&#34;next unless -f $file &amp;&amp;
        -T $file&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If any of the file tests (or either the
        <span class="Li">&#34;stat&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;lstat&#34;</span> operators) are given the
        special filehandle consisting of a solitary underline, then the stat
        structure of the previous file test (or stat operator) is used, saving a
        system call. (This doesn&#39;t work with
        <span class="Li">&#34;-t&#34;</span>, and you need to remember that
        <i>lstat()</i> and <span class="Li">&#34;-l&#34;</span> will leave
        values in the stat structure for the symbolic link, not the real file.)
        (Also, if the stat buffer was filled by a
        <span class="Li">&#34;lstat&#34;</span> call,
        <span class="Li">&#34;-T&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;-B&#34;</span> will reset it with the results of
        <span class="Li">&#34;stat _&#34;</span>). Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print &#34;Can do.\n&#34; if -r $a ⎪⎪ -w _ ⎪⎪ -x _;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    stat($filename);
    print &#34;Readable\n&#34; if -r _;
    print &#34;Writable\n&#34; if -w _;
    print &#34;Executable\n&#34; if -x _;
    print &#34;Setuid\n&#34; if -u _;
    print &#34;Setgid\n&#34; if -g _;
    print &#34;Sticky\n&#34; if -k _;
    print &#34;Text\n&#34; if -T _;
    print &#34;Binary\n&#34; if -B _;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>abs VALUE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>abs</dt>
  <dd>Returns the absolute value of its argument. If VALUE is omitted, uses
      <span class="Li">$_</span>.</dd>
  <dt>accept NEWSOCKET,GENERICSOCKET</dt>
  <dd>Accepts an incoming socket connect, just as the <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/accept.2.zh_CN.html">accept(2)</a> system
      call does. Returns the packed address if it succeeded, false otherwise.
      See the example in &#34;Sockets: Client/Server Communication&#34; in
      perlipc.
    <p class="Pp">On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on files, the
        flag will be set for the newly opened file descriptor, as determined by
        the value of $^F. See &#34;$^F&#34; in perlvar.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>alarm SECONDS</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>alarm</dt>
  <dd>Arranges to have a SIGALRM delivered to this process after the specified
      number of wallclock seconds have elapsed. If SECONDS is not specified, the
      value stored in <span class="Li">$_</span> is used. (On some machines,
      unfortunately, the elapsed time may be up to one second less or more than
      you specified because of how seconds are counted, and process scheduling
      may delay the delivery of the signal even further.)
    <p class="Pp">Only one timer may be counting at once. Each call disables the
        previous timer, and an argument of <span class="Li">0</span> may be
        supplied to cancel the previous timer without starting a new one. The
        returned value is the amount of time remaining on the previous
      timer.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For delays of finer granularity than one second, you may use
        Perl&#39;s four-argument version of <i>select()</i> leaving the first three
        arguments undefined, or you might be able to use the
        <span class="Li">&#34;syscall&#34;</span> interface to access
        <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/setitimer.2.en.html">setitimer(2)</a> if your system supports it. The Time::HiRes module
        (from CPAN, and starting from Perl 5.8 part of the standard
        distribution) may also prove useful.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is usually a mistake to intermix
        <span class="Li">&#34;alarm&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;sleep&#34;</span> calls.
        (<span class="Li">&#34;sleep&#34;</span> may be internally implemented
        in your system with <span class="Li">&#34;alarm&#34;</span>)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to use <span class="Li">&#34;alarm&#34;</span>
        to time out a system call you need to use an
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span>/<span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span>
        pair. You can&#39;t rely on the alarm causing the system call to fail with
        <span class="Li">$!</span> set to
        <span class="Li">&#34;EINTR&#34;</span> because Perl sets up signal
        handlers to restart system calls on some systems. Using
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span>/<span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span>
        always works, modulo the caveats given in &#34;Signals&#34; in
        perlipc.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval {
        local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die &#34;alarm\n&#34; }; # NB: \n required
        alarm $timeout;
        $nread = sysread SOCKET, $buffer, $size;
        alarm 0;
    };
    if ($@) {
        die unless $@ eq &#34;alarm\n&#34;;   # propagate unexpected errors
        # timed out
    }
    else {
        # didn&#39;t
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For more information see perlipc.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>atan2 Y,X</dt>
  <dd>Returns the arctangent of Y/X in the range -PI to PI.
    <p class="Pp">For the tangent operation, you may use the
        <span class="Li">&#34;Math::Trig::tan&#34;</span> function, or use the
        familiar relation:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub tan { sin($_[0]) / cos($_[0])  }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>bind SOCKET,NAME</dt>
  <dd>Binds a network address to a socket, just as the bind system call does.
      Returns true if it succeeded, false otherwise. NAME should be a packed
      address of the appropriate type for the socket. See the examples in
      &#34;Sockets: Client/Server Communication&#34; in perlipc.</dd>
  <dt>binmode FILEHANDLE, LAYER</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>binmode FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd>Arranges for FILEHANDLE to be read or written in &#34;binary&#34; or
      &#34;text&#34; mode on systems where the run-time libraries distinguish
      between binary and text files. If FILEHANDLE is an expression, the value
      is taken as the name of the filehandle. Returns true on success, otherwise
      it returns <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> and sets
      <span class="Li">$!</span> (errno).
    <p class="Pp">On some systems (in general, DOS and Windows-based systems)
        <i>binmode()</i> is necessary when you&#39;re not working with a text file.
        For the sake of portability it is a good idea to always use it when
        appropriate, and to never use it when it isn&#39;t appropriate. Also, people
        can set their I/O to be by default UTF-8 encoded Unicode, not bytes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In other words: regardless of platform, use <i>binmode()</i>
        on binary data, like for example images.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LAYER is present it is a single string, but may contain
        multiple directives. The directives alter the behaviour of the file
        handle. When LAYER is present using binmode on text file makes
      sense.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LAYER is omitted or specified as
        <span class="Li">&#34;:raw&#34;</span> the filehandle is made suitable
        for passing binary data. This includes turning off possible CRLF
        translation and marking it as bytes (as opposed to Unicode characters).
        Note that as despite what may be implied in <i>&#34;Programming
        Perl&#34;</i> (the Camel) or elsewhere
        <span class="Li">&#34;:raw&#34;</span> is <i>not</i> the simply
        inverse of <span class="Li">&#34;:crlf&#34;</span> -- other layers
        which would affect binary nature of the stream are <i>also</i> disabled.
        See PerlIO, perlrun and the discussion about the PERLIO environment
        variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&#34;:bytes&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;:crlf&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span>, and any other directives of
        the form <span class="Li">&#34;:...&#34;</span>, are called I/O
        <i>layers</i>. The <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> pragma can
        be used to establish default I/O layers. See open.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>The LAYER parameter of the </i><i>binmode()</i><i> function
        is described as &#34;DISCIPLINE&#34;</i> <i>in &#34;Programming Perl,
        3rd Edition&#34;. However, since the publishing of this</i> <i>book, by
        many known as &#34;Camel III&#34;, the consensus of the naming of
        this</i> <i>functionality has moved from &#34;discipline&#34; to
        &#34;layer&#34;. All documentation</i> <i>of this version of Perl
        therefore refers to &#34;layers&#34; rather than to</i>
        <i>&#34;disciplines&#34;. Now back to the regularly scheduled
        documentation...</i></p>
    <p class="Pp">To mark FILEHANDLE as UTF-8, use
        <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In general, <i>binmode()</i> should be called after
        <i>open()</i> but before any I/O is done on the filehandle. Calling
        <i>binmode()</i> will normally flush any pending buffered output data
        (and perhaps pending input data) on the handle. An exception to this is
        the <span class="Li">&#34;:encoding&#34;</span> layer that changes the
        default character encoding of the handle, see open. The
        <span class="Li">&#34;:encoding&#34;</span> layer sometimes needs to
        be called in mid-stream, and it doesn&#39;t flush the stream. The
        <span class="Li">&#34;:encoding&#34;</span> also implicitly pushes on
        top of itself the <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span> layer
        because internally Perl will operate on UTF-8 encoded Unicode
        characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The operating system, device drivers, C libraries, and Perl
        run-time system all work together to let the programmer treat a single
        character (<span class="Li">&#34;\n&#34;</span>) as the line
        terminator, irrespective of the external representation. On many
        operating systems, the native text file representation matches the
        internal representation, but on some platforms the external
        representation of <span class="Li">&#34;\n&#34;</span> is made up of
        more than one character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Mac OS, all variants of Unix, and Stream_LF files on VMS use a
        single character to end each line in the external representation of text
        (even though that single character is CARRIAGE RETURN on Mac OS and LINE
        FEED on Unix and most VMS files). In other systems like OS/2, DOS and
        the various flavors of MS-Windows your program sees a
        <span class="Li">&#34;\n&#34;</span> as a simple
        <span class="Li">&#34;\cJ&#34;</span>, but what&#39;s stored in text files
        are the two characters <span class="Li">&#34;\cM\cJ&#34;</span>. That
        means that, if you don&#39;t use <i>binmode()</i> on these systems,
        <span class="Li">&#34;\cM\cJ&#34;</span> sequences on disk will be
        converted to <span class="Li">&#34;\n&#34;</span> on input, and any
        <span class="Li">&#34;\n&#34;</span> in your program will be converted
        back to <span class="Li">&#34;\cM\cJ&#34;</span> on output. This is
        what you want for text files, but it can be disastrous for binary
      files.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another consequence of using <i>binmode()</i> (on some
        systems) is that special end-of-file markers will be seen as part of the
        data stream. For systems from the Microsoft family this means that if
        your binary data contains <span class="Li">&#34;\cZ&#34;</span>, the
        I/O subsystem will regard it as the end of the file, unless you use
        <i>binmode()</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>binmode()</i> is not only important for <i>readline()</i>
        and <i>print()</i> operations, but also when using <i>read()</i>,
        <i>seek()</i>, <i>sysread()</i>, <i>syswrite()</i> and <i>tell()</i>
        (see perlport for more details). See the <span class="Li">$/</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;$\&#34;</span> variables in perlvar for how to
        manually set your input and output line-termination sequences.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>bless REF,CLASSNAME</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>bless REF</dt>
  <dd>This function tells the thingy referenced by REF that it is now an object
      in the CLASSNAME package. If CLASSNAME is omitted, the current package is
      used. Because a <span class="Li">&#34;bless&#34;</span> is often the
      last thing in a constructor, it returns the reference for convenience.
      Always use the two-argument version if the function doing the blessing
      might be inherited by a derived class. See perltoot and perlobj for more
      about the blessing (and blessings) of objects.
    <p class="Pp">Consider always blessing objects in CLASSNAMEs that are mixed
        case. Namespaces with all lowercase names are considered reserved for
        Perl pragmata. Builtin types have all uppercase names, so to prevent
        confusion, you may wish to avoid such package names as well. Make sure
        that CLASSNAME is a true value.</p>

  <dd>Returns the context of the current subroutine call. In scalar context,

      in a subroutine or <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span>, and the undefined value

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($package, $filename, $line) = caller;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">With EXPR, it returns some extra information that the debugger
        uses to print a stack trace. The value of EXPR indicates how many call
        frames to go back before the current one.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Here <span class="Li">$subroutine</span> may be
        <span class="Li">&#34;(eval)&#34;</span> if the frame is not a

        such a case additional elements <span class="Li">$evaltext</span> and
        <span class="Li">$is_require</span> are set:
        <span class="Li">$is_require</span> is true if the frame is created by a
        <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;use&#34;</span> statement,
        <span class="Li">$evaltext</span> contains the text of the
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval EXPR&#34;</span> statement. In particular,
        for an <span class="Li">&#34;eval BLOCK&#34;</span> statement,
        <span class="Li">$filename</span> is
        <span class="Li">&#34;(eval)&#34;</span>, but
        <span class="Li">$evaltext</span> is undefined. (Note also that each
        <span class="Li">&#34;use&#34;</span> statement creates a
        <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span> frame inside an
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval EXPR&#34;</span> frame.)
        <span class="Li">$subroutine</span> may also be
        <span class="Li">&#34;(unknown)&#34;</span> if this particular
        subroutine happens to have been deleted from the symbol table.
        <span class="Li">$hasargs</span> is true if a new instance of

        <span class="Li">$hints</span> and <span class="Li">$bitmask</span>
        contain pragmatic hints that the caller was compiled with. The
        <span class="Li">$hints</span> and <span class="Li">$bitmask</span>
        values are subject to change between versions of Perl, and are not meant
        for external use.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Furthermore, when called from within the DB package, caller
        returns more detailed information: it sets the list variable
        <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> to be the arguments with which the
        subroutine was invoked.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Be aware that the optimizer might have optimized call frames

        get the information. That means that <span class="Li">caller(N)</span>
        might not return information about the call frame you expect it do, for
        <span class="Li">&#34;N &gt; 1&#34;</span>. In particular,

  <dt>chmod LIST</dt>
  <dd>Changes the permissions of a list of files. The first element of the list
      must be the numerical mode, which should probably be an octal number, and
      which definitely should <i>not</i> a string of octal digits:
      <span class="Li">0644</span> is okay, <span class="Li">&#39;0644&#39;</span> is

  <dt>chomp VARIABLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>chomp( LIST )</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>chomp</dt>
  <dd>This safer version of &#34;chop&#34; removes any trailing string that
      corresponds to the current value of <span class="Li">$/</span> (also known
      as <span class="Li">$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR</span> in the
      <span class="Li">&#34;English&#34;</span> module). It returns the total
      number of characters removed from all its arguments. It&#39;s often used to
      remove the newline from the end of an input record when you&#39;re worried
      that the final record may be missing its newline. When in paragraph mode
      (<span class="Li">&#34;$/ = &#34;&#34;&#34;</span>), it removes all
      trailing newlines from the string. When in slurp mode
      (<span class="Li">&#34;$/ = undef&#34;</span>) or fixed-length record
      mode (<span class="Li">$/</span> is a reference to an integer or the like,
      see perlvar) <i>chomp()</i> won&#39;t remove anything. If VARIABLE is omitted,
      it chomps <span class="Li">$_</span>. Example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        chomp;  # avoid \n on last field
        @array = split(/:/);
        # ...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If VARIABLE is a hash, it chomps the hash&#39;s values, but not
        its keys.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can actually chomp anything that&#39;s an lvalue, including an
        assignment:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    chomp($cwd = `pwd`);
    chomp($answer = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you chomp a list, each element is chomped, and the total
        number of characters removed is returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that parentheses are necessary when you&#39;re chomping
        anything that is not a simple variable. This is because
        <span class="Li">&#34;chomp $cwd = `pwd`;&#34;</span> is interpreted
        as <span class="Li">&#34;(chomp $cwd) = `pwd`;&#34;</span>, rather
        than as <span class="Li">&#34;chomp( $cwd = `pwd` )&#34;</span> which
        you might expect. Similarly, <span class="Li">&#34;chomp $a,
        $b&#34;</span> is interpreted as <span class="Li">&#34;chomp($a),
        $b&#34;</span> rather than as <span class="Li">&#34;chomp($a,

  <dt>chop( LIST )</dt>

  <dt>chop</dt>
  <dd>Chops off the last character of a string and returns the character
      chopped. It is much more efficient than
      <span class="Li">&#34;s/.$//s&#34;</span> because it neither scans nor
      copies the string. If VARIABLE is omitted, chops
      <span class="Li">$_</span>. If VARIABLE is a hash, it chops the hash&#39;s
      values, but not its keys.
    <p class="Pp">You can actually chop anything that&#39;s an lvalue, including an
        assignment.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you chop a list, each element is chopped. Only the value of

    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&#34;chop&#34;</span> returns the

  <dt>chown LIST</dt>
  <dd>Changes the owner (and group) of a list of files. The first two elements
      of the list must be the <i>numeric</i> uid and gid, in that order. A value
      of -1 in either position is interpreted by most systems to leave that
      value unchanged. Returns the number of files successfully changed.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $cnt = chown $uid, $gid, &#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;;
    chown $uid, $gid, @filenames;

  <dt>chr NUMBER</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>chr</dt>
  <dd>Returns the character represented by that NUMBER in the character set. For
      example, <span class="Li">&#34;chr(65)&#34;</span> is
      <span class="Li">&#34;A&#34;</span> in either ASCII or Unicode, and
      chr(0x263a) is a Unicode smiley face. Note that characters from 128 to 255

      compatibility reasons (but see encoding).

  <dt>chroot FILENAME</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>chroot</dt>
  <dd>This function works like the system call by the same name: it makes the
      named directory the new root directory for all further pathnames that
      begin with a <span class="Li">&#34;/&#34;</span> by your process and all
      its children. (It doesn&#39;t change your current working directory, which is

  <dt>close FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>close</dt>
  <dd>Closes the file or pipe associated with the file handle, returning true
      only if IO buffers are successfully flushed and closes the system file
      descriptor. Closes the currently selected filehandle if the argument is
      omitted.
    <p class="Pp">You don&#39;t have to close FILEHANDLE if you are immediately
        going to do another <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> on it,
        because <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> will close it for you.
        (See <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span>.) However, an explicit
        <span class="Li">&#34;close&#34;</span> on an input file resets the
        line counter (<span class="Li">$.</span>), while the implicit close done
        by <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> does not.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the file handle came from a piped open
        <span class="Li">&#34;close&#34;</span> will additionally return false
        if one of the other system calls involved fails or if the program exits
        with non-zero status. (If the only problem was that the program exited
        non-zero <span class="Li">$!</span> will be set to
        <span class="Li">0</span>.) Closing a pipe also waits for the process
        executing on the pipe to complete, in case you want to look at the
        output of the pipe afterwards, and implicitly puts the exit status value
        of that command into <span class="Li">$?</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Prematurely closing the read end of a pipe (i.e. before the
        process writing to it at the other end has closed it) will result in a
        SIGPIPE being delivered to the writer. If the other end can&#39;t handle
        that, be sure to read all the data before closing the pipe.</p>

      <span class="Li">&#34;continue&#34;</span> BLOCK attached to a BLOCK
      (typically in a <span class="Li">&#34;while&#34;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&#34;foreach&#34;</span>), it is always executed just
      before the conditional is about to be evaluated again, just like the third
      part of a <span class="Li">&#34;for&#34;</span> loop in C. Thus it can
      be used to increment a loop variable, even when the loop has been
      continued via the <span class="Li">&#34;next&#34;</span> statement
      (which is similar to the C <span class="Li">&#34;continue&#34;</span>
      statement).
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&#34;last&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;next&#34;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&#34;redo&#34;</span> may appear within a
        <span class="Li">&#34;continue&#34;</span> block.
        <span class="Li">&#34;last&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;redo&#34;</span> will behave as if they had been
        executed within the main block. So will
        <span class="Li">&#34;next&#34;</span>, but since it will execute a
        <span class="Li">&#34;continue&#34;</span> block, it may be more
        entertaining.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    while (EXPR) {
        ### redo always comes here
        do_something;
    } continue {
        ### next always comes here
        do_something_else;
        # then back the top to re-check EXPR
    }
    ### last always comes here
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Omitting the <span class="Li">&#34;continue&#34;</span>
        section is semantically equivalent to using an empty one, logically
        enough. In that case, <span class="Li">&#34;next&#34;</span> goes
        directly back to check the condition at the top of the loop.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>cos EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>cos</dt>
  <dd>Returns the cosine of EXPR (expressed in radians). If EXPR is omitted,
      takes cosine of <span class="Li">$_</span>.
    <p class="Pp">For the inverse cosine operation, you may use the
        <span class="Li">&#34;Math::Trig::acos()&#34;</span> function, or use
        this relation:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub acos { atan2( sqrt(1 - $_[0] * $_[0]), $_[0] ) }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>crypt PLAINTEXT,SALT</dt>
  <dd>Encrypts a string exactly like the <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/crypt.3.en.html">crypt(3)</a> function in the C
      library (assuming that you actually have a version there that has not been
      extirpated as a potential munition). This can prove useful for checking
      the password file for lousy passwords, amongst other things. Only the guys
      wearing white hats should do this.
    <p class="Pp">Note that crypt is intended to be a one-way function, much
        like breaking eggs to make an omelette. There is no (known)
        corresponding decrypt function (in other words, the <i>crypt()</i> is a
        one-way hash function). As a result, this function isn&#39;t all that useful
        for cryptography. (For that, see your nearby CPAN mirror.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">When verifying an existing encrypted string you should use the
        encrypted text as the salt (like <span class="Li">&#34;crypt($plain,
        $crypted) eq</span> <span class="Li">$crypted&#34;</span>). This allows
        your code to work with the standard crypt and with more exotic
        implementations. In other words, do not assume anything about the
        returned string itself, or how many bytes in the encrypted string
        matter.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Traditionally the result is a string of 13 bytes: two first
        bytes of the salt, followed by 11 bytes from the set
        <span class="Li">&#34;[./0-9A-Za-z]&#34;</span>, and only the first
        eight bytes of the encrypted string mattered, but alternative hashing
        schemes (like MD5), higher level security schemes (like C2), and
        implementations on non-UNIX platforms may produce different strings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When choosing a new salt create a random two character string
        whose characters come from the set
        <span class="Li">&#34;[./0-9A-Za-z]&#34;</span> (like
        <span class="Li">&#34;join &#39;&#39;, (&#39;.&#39;,</span> <span class="Li">&#39;/&#39;, 0..9,
        &#39;A&#39;..&#39;Z&#39;, &#39;a&#39;..&#39;z&#39;)[rand 64, rand 64]&#34;</span>). This set of
        characters is just a recommendation; the characters allowed in the salt
        depend solely on your system&#39;s crypt library, and Perl can&#39;t restrict
        what salts <span class="Li">&#34;crypt()&#34;</span> accepts.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here&#39;s an example that makes sure that whoever runs this
        program knows their own password:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $pwd = (getpwuid($&lt;))[1];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    system &#34;stty -echo&#34;;
    print &#34;Password: &#34;;
    chomp($word = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
    print &#34;\n&#34;;
    system &#34;stty echo&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (crypt($word, $pwd) ne $pwd) {
        die &#34;Sorry...\n&#34;;
    } else {
        print &#34;ok\n&#34;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Of course, typing in your own password to whoever asks you for
        it is unwise.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The crypt function is unsuitable for encrypting large
        quantities of data, not least of all because you can&#39;t get the
        information back. Look at the <i>by-module/Crypt</i> and
        <i>by-module/PGP</i> directories on your favorite CPAN mirror for a slew
        of potentially useful modules.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If using <i>crypt()</i> on a Unicode string (which
        <i>potentially</i> has characters with codepoints above 255), Perl tries
        to make sense of the situation by trying to downgrade (a copy of the
        string) the string back to an eight-bit byte string before calling
        <i>crypt()</i> (on that copy). If that works, good. If not,
        <i>crypt()</i> dies with <span class="Li">&#34;Wide character in
        crypt&#34;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>dbmclose HASH</dt>
  <dd>[This function has been largely superseded by the
      <span class="Li">&#34;untie&#34;</span> function.]
    <p class="Pp">Breaks the binding between a DBM file and a hash.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>dbmopen HASH,DBNAME,MASK</dt>
  <dd>[This function has been largely superseded by the
      <span class="Li">&#34;tie&#34;</span> function.]
    <p class="Pp">This binds a <i>dbm</i>(3), <i>ndbm</i>(3), <i>sdbm</i>(3),
        <a href="../../buster/libgdbm-dev/gdbm.3.en.html">gdbm(3)</a>, or Berkeley DB file to a hash. HASH is the name of the
        hash. (Unlike normal <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span>, the first
        argument is <i>not</i> a filehandle, even though it looks like one).
        DBNAME is the name of the database (without the <i>.dir</i> or
        <i>.pag</i> extension if any). If the database does not exist, it is
        created with protection specified by MASK (as modified by the
        <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span>). If your system supports only
        the older DBM functions, you may perform only one
        <span class="Li">&#34;dbmopen&#34;</span> in your program. In older
        versions of Perl, if your system had neither DBM nor ndbm, calling
        <span class="Li">&#34;dbmopen&#34;</span> produced a fatal error; it
        now falls back to <i>sdbm</i>(3).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you don&#39;t have write access to the DBM file, you can only
        read hash variables, not set them. If you want to test whether you can
        write, either use file tests or try setting a dummy hash entry inside an
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span>, which will trap the error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that functions such as
        <span class="Li">&#34;keys&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;values&#34;</span> may return huge lists when
        used on large DBM files. You may prefer to use the
        <span class="Li">&#34;each&#34;</span> function to iterate over large
        DBM files. Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # print out history file offsets
    dbmopen(%HIST,&#39;/usr/lib/news/history&#39;,0666);
    while (($key,$val) = each %HIST) {
        print $key, &#39; = &#39;, unpack(&#39;L&#39;,$val), &#34;\n&#34;;
    }
    dbmclose(%HIST);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also AnyDBM_File for a more general description of the
        pros and cons of the various dbm approaches, as well as DB_File for a
        particularly rich implementation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can control which DBM library you use by loading that
        library before you call <i>dbmopen()</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use DB_File;
    dbmopen(%NS_Hist, &#34;$ENV{HOME}/.netscape/history.db&#34;)
        or die &#34;Can&#39;t open netscape history file: $!&#34;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>defined EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>defined</dt>
  <dd>Returns a Boolean value telling whether EXPR has a value other than the
      undefined value <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span>. If EXPR is not
      present, <span class="Li">$_</span> will be checked.
    <p class="Pp">Many operations return
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> to indicate failure, end of
        file, system error, uninitialized variable, and other exceptional
        conditions. This function allows you to distinguish
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> from other values. (A simple
        Boolean test will not distinguish among
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span>, zero, the empty string, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;0&#34;</span>, which are all equally false.)
        Note that since <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> is a valid
        scalar, its presence doesn&#39;t <i>necessarily</i> indicate an exceptional
        condition: <span class="Li">&#34;pop&#34;</span> returns
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> when its argument is an empty
        array, <i>or</i> when the element to return happens to be
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may also use
        <span class="Li">&#34;defined(&amp;func)&#34;</span> to check whether
        subroutine <span class="Li">&amp;func</span> has ever been defined. The
        return value is unaffected by any forward declarations of
        <span class="Li">&amp;func</span>. Note that a subroutine which is not
        defined may still be callable: its package may have an
        <span class="Li">&#34;AUTOLOAD&#34;</span> method that makes it spring
        into existence the first time that it is called -- see perlsub.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use of <span class="Li">&#34;defined&#34;</span> on
        aggregates (hashes and arrays) is deprecated. It used to report whether
        memory for that aggregate has ever been allocated. This behavior may
        disappear in future versions of Perl. You should instead use a simple
        test for size:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (@an_array) { print &#34;has array elements\n&#34; }
    if (%a_hash)   { print &#34;has hash members\n&#34;   }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When used on a hash element, it tells you whether the value is
        defined, not whether the key exists in the hash. Use &#34;exists&#34;
        for the latter purpose.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print if defined $switch{&#39;D&#39;};
    print &#34;$val\n&#34; while defined($val = pop(@ary));
    die &#34;Can&#39;t readlink $sym: $!&#34;
        unless defined($value = readlink $sym);
    sub foo { defined &amp;$bar ? &amp;$bar(@_) : die &#34;No bar&#34;; }
    $debugging = 0 unless defined $debugging;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note: Many folks tend to overuse
        <span class="Li">&#34;defined&#34;</span>, and then are surprised to
        discover that the number <span class="Li">0</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;&#34;</span> (the zero-length string) are, in
        fact, defined values. For example, if you say</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &#34;ab&#34; =~ /a(.*)b/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The pattern match succeeds, and <span class="Li">$1</span> is
        defined, despite the fact that it matched &#34;nothing&#34;. But it
        didn&#39;t really match nothing--rather, it matched something that happened
        to be zero characters long. This is all very above-board and honest.
        When a function returns an undefined value, it&#39;s an admission that it
        couldn&#39;t give you an honest answer. So you should use
        <span class="Li">&#34;defined&#34;</span> only when you&#39;re questioning
        the integrity of what you&#39;re trying to do. At other times, a simple
        comparison to <span class="Li">0</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;&#34;</span> is what you want.</p>

  <dt>delete EXPR</dt>
  <dd>Given an expression that specifies a hash element, array element, hash
      slice, or array slice, deletes the specified element(s) from the hash or
      array. In the case of an array, if the array elements happen to be at the
      end, the size of the array will shrink to the highest element that tests
      true for <i>exists()</i> (or 0 if no such element exists).
    <p class="Pp">Returns each element so deleted or the undefined value if
        there was no such element. Deleting from <span class="Li">$ENV{}</span>
        modifies the environment. Deleting from a hash tied to a DBM file
        deletes the entry from the DBM file. Deleting from a
        <span class="Li">&#34;tie&#34;</span>d hash or array may not
        necessarily return anything.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Deleting an array element effectively returns that position of
        the array to its initial, uninitialized state. Subsequently testing for
        the same element with <i>exists()</i> will return false. Note that
        deleting array elements in the middle of an array will not shift the
        index of the ones after them down--use <i>splice()</i> for that. See
        &#34;exists&#34;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The following (inefficiently) deletes all the values of
        <span class="Li">%HASH</span> and <span class="Li">@ARRAY:</span></p>

    <pre>    foreach $index (0 .. $#ARRAY) {

    <p class="Pp">And so do these:</p>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    delete @ARRAY[0 .. $#ARRAY];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">But both of these are slower than just assigning the empty

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    %HASH = ();         # completely empty %HASH

    <p class="Pp">If LIST is empty and <span class="Li">$@</span> already
        contains a value (typically from a previous eval) that value is reused
        after appending <span class="Li">&#34;\t...propagated&#34;</span>.
        This is useful for propagating exceptions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval { ... };

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If LIST is empty and <span class="Li">$@</span> contains an

        <span class="Li">&#34;PROPAGATE&#34;</span> method, that method will
        be called with additional file and line number parameters. The return

        matching particular string values of $@ using regular expressions.
        Here&#39;s an example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval { ... ; die Some::Module::Exception-&gt;new( FOO =&gt; &#34;bar&#34; ) };

    <p class="Pp">Because perl will stringify uncaught exception messages before

        such custom exception objects. See overload for details about that.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can arrange for a callback to be run just before the
        <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span> does its deed, by setting the
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> hook. The associated handler will
        be called with the error text and can change the error message, if it
        sees fit, by calling <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span> again. See
        &#34;$SIG{expr}&#34; in perlvar for details on setting
        <span class="Li">%SIG</span> entries, and &#34;eval BLOCK&#34; for
        some examples. Although this feature was meant to be run only right
        before your program was to exit, this is not currently the case--the
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> hook is currently called even
        inside <i>eval()</i>ed blocks/strings! If one wants the hook to do
        nothing in such situations, put</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        die @_ if $^S;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">as the first line of the handler (see &#34;$^S&#34; in
        perlvar). Because this promotes strange action at a distance, this
        counterintuitive behavior may be fixed in a future release.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>do BLOCK</dt>
  <dd>Not really a function. Returns the value of the last command in the
      sequence of commands indicated by BLOCK. When modified by a loop modifier,
      executes the BLOCK once before testing the loop condition. (On other
      statements the loop modifiers test the conditional first.)
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&#34;do BLOCK&#34;</span> does <i>not</i>
        count as a loop, so the loop control statements
        <span class="Li">&#34;next&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;last&#34;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&#34;redo&#34;</span> cannot be used to leave or
        restart the block. See perlsyn for alternative strategies.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>do SUBROUTINE(LIST)</dt>
  <dd>A deprecated form of subroutine call. See perlsub.</dd>
  <dt>do EXPR</dt>
  <dd>Uses the value of EXPR as a filename and executes the contents of the file
      as a Perl script. Its primary use is to include subroutines from a Perl
      subroutine library.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    do &#39;stat.pl&#39;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is just like</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval `cat stat.pl`;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">except that it&#39;s more efficient and concise, keeps track of
        the current filename for error messages, searches the
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> libraries, and updates
        <span class="Li">%INC</span> if the file is found. See &#34;Predefined
        Names&#34; in perlvar for these variables. It also differs in that code
        evaluated with <span class="Li">&#34;do FILENAME&#34;</span> cannot
        see lexicals in the enclosing scope; <span class="Li">&#34;eval
        STRING&#34;</span> does. It&#39;s the same, however, in that it does
        reparse the file every time you call it, so you probably don&#39;t want to
        do this inside a loop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&#34;do&#34;</span> cannot read the
        file, it returns undef and sets <span class="Li">$!</span> to the error.
        If <span class="Li">&#34;do&#34;</span> can read the file but cannot
        compile it, it returns undef and sets an error message in
        <span class="Li">$@</span>. If the file is successfully compiled,
        <span class="Li">&#34;do&#34;</span> returns the value of the last
        expression evaluated.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that inclusion of library modules is better done with the
        <span class="Li">&#34;use&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span> operators, which also do
        automatic error checking and raise an exception if there&#39;s a
      problem.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You might like to use <span class="Li">&#34;do&#34;</span>
        to read in a program configuration file. Manual error checking can be
        done this way:</p>

  <dt>dump LABEL</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>dump</dt>
  <dd>This function causes an immediate core dump. See also the <b>-u</b>
      command-line switch in perlrun, which does the same thing. Primarily this
      is so that you can use the <b>undump</b> program (not supplied) to turn
      your core dump into an executable binary after having initialized all your
      variables at the beginning of the program. When the new binary is executed
      it will begin by executing a <span class="Li">&#34;goto
      LABEL&#34;</span> (with all the restrictions that
      <span class="Li">&#34;goto&#34;</span> suffers). Think of it as a goto
      with an intervening core dump and reincarnation. If
      <span class="Li">&#34;LABEL&#34;</span> is omitted, restarts the program
      from the top.
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: Any files opened at the time of the dump will
        <i>not</i> be open any more when the program is reincarnated, with
        possible resulting confusion on the part of Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This function is now largely obsolete, partly because it&#39;s
        very hard to convert a core file into an executable, and because the
        real compiler backends for generating portable bytecode and compilable C
        code have superseded it. That&#39;s why you should now invoke it as
        <span class="Li">&#34;CORE::dump()&#34;</span>, if you don&#39;t want to
        be warned against a possible typo.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you&#39;re looking to use dump to speed up your program,
        consider generating bytecode or native C code as described in perlcc. If
        you&#39;re just trying to accelerate a CGI script, consider using the
        <span class="Li">&#34;mod_perl&#34;</span> extension to <b>Apache</b>,
        or the CPAN module, CGI::Fast. You might also consider autoloading or
        selfloading, which at least make your program <i>appear</i> to run
        faster.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>each HASH</dt>
  <dd>When called in list context, returns a 2-element list consisting of the
      key and value for the next element of a hash, so that you can iterate over
      it. When called in scalar context, returns only the key for the next
      element in the hash.
    <p class="Pp">Entries are returned in an apparently random order. The actual
        random order is subject to change in future versions of perl, but it is
        guaranteed to be in the same order as either the
        <span class="Li">&#34;keys&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;values&#34;</span> function would produce on the
        same (unmodified) hash. Since Perl 5.8.1 the ordering is different even
        between different runs of Perl for security reasons (see
        &#34;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&#34; in perlsec).</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the hash is entirely read, a null array is returned in
        list context (which when assigned produces a false
        (<span class="Li">0</span>) value), and
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> in scalar context. The next
        call to <span class="Li">&#34;each&#34;</span> after that will start
        iterating again. There is a single iterator for each hash, shared by all
        <span class="Li">&#34;each&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;keys&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;values&#34;</span> function calls in the
        program; it can be reset by reading all the elements from the hash, or
        by evaluating <span class="Li">&#34;keys HASH&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;values HASH&#34;</span>. If you add or delete
        elements of a hash while you&#39;re iterating over it, you may get entries
        skipped or duplicated, so don&#39;t. Exception: It is always safe to delete
        the item most recently returned by
        <span class="Li">&#34;each()&#34;</span>, which means that the
        following code will work:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        while (($key, $value) = each %hash) {
          print $key, &#34;\n&#34;;
          delete $hash{$key};   # This is safe
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The following prints out your environment like the
        <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/printenv.1.zh_CN.html">printenv(1)</a> program, only in a different order:</p>

    <pre>    while (($key,$value) = each %ENV) {

  </dd>
  <dt>eof FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>eof ()</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>eof</dt>
  <dd>Returns 1 if the next read on FILEHANDLE will return end of file, or if
      FILEHANDLE is not open. FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives
      the real filehandle. (Note that this function actually reads a character
      and then <span class="Li">&#34;ungetc&#34;</span>s it, so isn&#39;t very
      useful in an interactive context.) Do not read from a terminal file (or
      call <span class="Li">&#34;eof(FILEHANDLE)&#34;</span> on it) after
      end-of-file is reached. File types such as terminals may lose the
      end-of-file condition if you do.
    <p class="Pp">An <span class="Li">&#34;eof&#34;</span> without an argument
        uses the last file read. Using <span class="Li">&#34;eof()&#34;</span>
        with empty parentheses is very different. It refers to the pseudo file
        formed from the files listed on the command line and accessed via the
        <span class="Li">&#34;&lt;&gt;&#34;</span> operator. Since
        <span class="Li">&#34;&lt;&gt;&#34;</span> isn&#39;t explicitly opened, as
        a normal filehandle is, an <span class="Li">&#34;eof()&#34;</span>
        before <span class="Li">&#34;&lt;&gt;&#34;</span> has been used will
        cause <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> to be examined to determine if input
        is available. Similarly, an <span class="Li">&#34;eof()&#34;</span>
        after <span class="Li">&#34;&lt;&gt;&#34;</span> has returned
        end-of-file will assume you are processing another
        <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> list, and if you haven&#39;t set
        <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>, will read input from
        <span class="Li">&#34;STDIN&#34;</span>; see &#34;I/O Operators&#34;
        in perlop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In a <span class="Li">&#34;while (&lt;&gt;)&#34;</span>
        loop, <span class="Li">&#34;eof&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;eof(ARGV)&#34;</span> can be used to detect the
        end of each file, <span class="Li">&#34;eof()&#34;</span> will only
        detect the end of the last file. Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # reset line numbering on each input file
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        next if /^\s*#/;        # skip comments
        print &#34;$.\t$_&#34;;
    } continue {
        close ARGV  if eof;     # Not eof()!
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # insert dashes just before last line of last file
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        if (eof()) {            # check for end of last file
            print &#34;--------------\n&#34;;
        }
        print;
        last if eof();          # needed if we&#39;re reading from a terminal
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Practical hint: you almost never need to use
        <span class="Li">&#34;eof&#34;</span> in Perl, because the input
        operators typically return <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span>
        when they run out of data, or if there was an error.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>eval EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>eval BLOCK</dt>
  <dd>In the first form, the return value of EXPR is parsed and executed as if
      it were a little Perl program. The value of the expression (which is
      itself determined within scalar context) is first parsed, and if there
      weren&#39;t any errors, executed in the lexical context of the current Perl
      program, so that any variable settings or subroutine and format
      definitions remain afterwards. Note that the value is parsed every time
      the eval executes. If EXPR is omitted, evaluates
      <span class="Li">$_</span>. This form is typically used to delay parsing
      and subsequent execution of the text of EXPR until run time.
    <p class="Pp">In the second form, the code within the BLOCK is parsed only
        once--at the same time the code surrounding the eval itself was
        parsed--and executed within the context of the current Perl program.
        This form is typically used to trap exceptions more efficiently than the
        first (see below), while also providing the benefit of checking the code
        within BLOCK at compile time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The final semicolon, if any, may be omitted from the value of
        EXPR or within the BLOCK.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In both forms, the value returned is the value of the last
        expression evaluated inside the mini-program; a return statement may be
        also used, just as with subroutines. The expression providing the return
        value is evaluated in void, scalar, or list context, depending on the
        context of the eval itself. See &#34;wantarray&#34; for more on how
        the evaluation context can be determined.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If there is a syntax error or runtime error, or a
        <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span> statement is executed, an
        undefined value is returned by <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span>,
        and <span class="Li">$@</span> is set to the error message. If there was
        no error, <span class="Li">$@</span> is guaranteed to be a null string.
        Beware that using <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span> neither
        silences perl from printing warnings to STDERR, nor does it stuff the
        text of warning messages into <span class="Li">$@</span>. To do either
        of those, you have to use the <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span>
        facility, or turn off warnings inside the BLOCK or EXPR using
        <span class="Li">&#34;no warnings &#39;all&#39;&#34;</span>. See
        &#34;warn&#34;, perlvar, warnings and perllexwarn.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that, because <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span>
        traps otherwise-fatal errors, it is useful for determining whether a
        particular feature (such as <span class="Li">&#34;socket&#34;</span>
        or <span class="Li">&#34;symlink&#34;</span>) is implemented. It is
        also Perl&#39;s exception trapping mechanism, where the die operator is used
        to raise exceptions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the code to be executed doesn&#39;t vary, you may use the
        eval-BLOCK form to trap run-time errors without incurring the penalty of
        recompiling each time. The error, if any, is still returned in
        <span class="Li">$@</span>. Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # make divide-by-zero nonfatal
    eval { $answer = $a / $b; }; warn $@ if $@;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # same thing, but less efficient
    eval &#39;$answer = $a / $b&#39;; warn $@ if $@;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # a compile-time error
    eval { $answer = };                 # WRONG
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # a run-time error
    eval &#39;$answer =&#39;;   # sets $@
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Due to the current arguably broken state of
        <span class="Li">&#34;__DIE__&#34;</span> hooks, when using the
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval{}&#34;</span> form as an exception trap in
        libraries, you may wish not to trigger any
        <span class="Li">&#34;__DIE__&#34;</span> hooks that user code may
        have installed. You can use the <span class="Li">&#34;local
        $SIG{__DIE__}&#34;</span> construct for this purpose, as shown in this
        example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # a very private exception trap for divide-by-zero
    eval { local $SIG{&#39;__DIE__&#39;}; $answer = $a / $b; };
    warn $@ if $@;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is especially significant, given that
        <span class="Li">&#34;__DIE__&#34;</span> hooks can call
        <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span> again, which has the effect of
        changing their error messages:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # __DIE__ hooks may modify error messages
    {
       local $SIG{&#39;__DIE__&#39;} =
              sub { (my $x = $_[0]) =~ s/foo/bar/g; die $x };
       eval { die &#34;foo lives here&#34; };
       print $@ if $@;                # prints &#34;bar lives here&#34;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Because this promotes action at a distance, this
        counterintuitive behavior may be fixed in a future release.</p>
    <p class="Pp">With an <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span>, you should
        be especially careful to remember what&#39;s being looked at when:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval $x;            # CASE 1
    eval &#34;$x&#34;;          # CASE 2
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval &#39;$x&#39;;          # CASE 3
    eval { $x };        # CASE 4
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval &#34;\$$x++&#34;;      # CASE 5
    $$x++;              # CASE 6
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Cases 1 and 2 above behave identically: they run the code
        contained in the variable <span class="Li">$x</span>. (Although case 2
        has misleading double quotes making the reader wonder what else might be
        happening (nothing is).) Cases 3 and 4 likewise behave in the same way:
        they run the code <span class="Li">&#39;$x&#39;</span>, which does nothing but
        return the value of <span class="Li">$x</span>. (Case 4 is preferred for
        purely visual reasons, but it also has the advantage of compiling at
        compile-time instead of at run-time.) Case 5 is a place where normally
        you <i>would</i> like to use double quotes, except that in this
        particular situation, you can just use symbolic references instead, as
        in case 6.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&#34;eval BLOCK&#34;</span> does <i>not</i>
        count as a loop, so the loop control statements

        <span class="Li">&#34;redo&#34;</span> cannot be used to leave or

    <p class="Pp">Note that as a very special case, an
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval &#39;&#39;&#34;</span> executed within the
        <span class="Li">&#34;DB&#34;</span> package doesn&#39;t see the usual
        surrounding lexical scope, but rather the scope of the first non-DB
        piece of code that called it. You don&#39;t normally need to worry about
        this unless you are writing a Perl debugger.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>exec LIST</dt>

  <dt>exec PROGRAM LIST</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&#34;exec&#34;</span> function executes a system

      <span class="Li">&#34;system&#34;</span> instead of

    <p class="Pp">Since it&#39;s a common mistake to use

        If you <i>really</i> want to follow an
        <span class="Li">&#34;exec&#34;</span> with some other statement, you
        can use one of these styles to avoid the warning:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    exec (&#39;foo&#39;)   or print STDERR &#34;couldn&#39;t exec foo: $!&#34;;
    { exec (&#39;foo&#39;) }; print STDERR &#34;couldn&#39;t exec foo: $!&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If there is more than one argument in LIST, or if LIST is an
        array with more than one value, calls <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/execvp.3.en.html">execvp(3)</a> with the
        arguments in LIST. If there is only one scalar argument or an array with
        one element in it, the argument is checked for shell metacharacters, and
        if there are any, the entire argument is passed to the system&#39;s command
        shell for parsing (this is <span class="Li">&#34;/bin/sh
        -c&#34;</span> on Unix platforms, but varies on other platforms). If
        there are no shell metacharacters in the argument, it is split into
        words and passed directly to <span class="Li">&#34;execvp&#34;</span>,
        which is more efficient. Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    exec &#39;/bin/echo&#39;, &#39;Your arguments are: &#39;, @ARGV;
    exec &#34;sort $outfile ⎪ uniq&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you don&#39;t really want to execute the first argument, but
        want to lie to the program you are executing about its own name, you can
        specify the program you actually want to run as an &#34;indirect
        object&#34; (without a comma) in front of the LIST. (This always forces
        interpretation of the LIST as a multivalued list, even if there is only
        a single scalar in the list.) Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $shell = &#39;/bin/csh&#39;;
    exec $shell &#39;-sh&#39;;          # pretend it&#39;s a login shell
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or, more directly,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    exec {&#39;/bin/csh&#39;} &#39;-sh&#39;;    # pretend it&#39;s a login shell
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When the arguments get executed via the system shell, results
        will be subject to its quirks and capabilities. See &#34;`STRING`&#34;
        in perlop for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using an indirect object with
        <span class="Li">&#34;exec&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;system&#34;</span> is also more secure. This
        usage (which also works fine with <i>system()</i>) forces interpretation
        of the arguments as a multivalued list, even if the list had just one
        argument. That way you&#39;re safe from the shell expanding wildcards or
        splitting up words with whitespace in them.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @args = ( &#34;echo surprise&#34; );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    exec @args;               # subject to shell escapes
                                # if @args == 1
    exec { $args[0] } @args;  # safe even with one-arg list
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The first version, the one without the indirect object, ran
        the <i>echo</i> program, passing it
        <span class="Li">&#34;surprise&#34;</span> an argument. The second
        version didn&#39;t--it tried to run a program literally called <i>&#34;echo
        surprise&#34;</i>, didn&#39;t find it, and set <span class="Li">$?</span>
        to a non-zero value indicating failure.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Beginning with v5.6.0, Perl will attempt to flush all files
        opened for output before the exec, but this may not be supported on some
        platforms (see perlport). To be safe, you may need to set
        <span class="Li">$⎪</span> ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or call the
        <span class="Li">&#34;autoflush()&#34;</span> method of
        <span class="Li">&#34;IO::Handle&#34;</span> on any open handles in
        order to avoid lost output.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&#34;exec&#34;</span> will not
        call your <span class="Li">&#34;END&#34;</span> blocks, nor will it
        call any <span class="Li">&#34;DESTROY&#34;</span> methods in your
        objects.</p>

  <dt>exists EXPR</dt>
  <dd>Given an expression that specifies a hash element or array element,
      returns true if the specified element in the hash or array has ever been

      tty-handling operations. If FILEHANDLE is an expression, the value is
      taken as an indirect filehandle, generally its name.
    <p class="Pp">You can use this to find out whether two handles refer to the
        same underlying descriptor:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (fileno(THIS) == fileno(THAT)) {

  </dd>
  <dt>flock FILEHANDLE,OPERATION</dt>
  <dd>Calls <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/flock.2.en.html">flock(2)</a>, or an emulation of it, on FILEHANDLE. Returns true
      for success, false on failure. Produces a fatal error if used on a machine
      that doesn&#39;t implement <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/flock.2.en.html">flock(2)</a>, <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/fcntl.2.en.html">fcntl(2)</a> locking, or
      <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/lockf.3.en.html">lockf(3)</a>. <span class="Li">&#34;flock&#34;</span> is Perl&#39;s
      portable file locking interface, although it locks only entire files, not
      records.
    <p class="Pp">Two potentially non-obvious but traditional
        <span class="Li">&#34;flock&#34;</span> semantics are that it waits
        indefinitely until the lock is granted, and that its locks <b>merely
        advisory</b>. Such discretionary locks are more flexible, but offer
        fewer guarantees. This means that files locked with
        <span class="Li">&#34;flock&#34;</span> may be modified by programs
        that do not also use <span class="Li">&#34;flock&#34;</span>. See
        perlport, your port&#39;s specific documentation, or your system-specific
        local manpages for details. It&#39;s best to assume traditional behavior if
        you&#39;re writing portable programs. (But if you&#39;re not, you should as
        always feel perfectly free to write for your own system&#39;s idiosyncrasies
        (sometimes called &#34;features&#34;). Slavish adherence to
        portability concerns shouldn&#39;t get in the way of your getting your job
        done.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">OPERATION is one of LOCK_SH, LOCK_EX, or LOCK_UN, possibly
        combined with LOCK_NB. These constants are traditionally valued 1, 2, 8
        and 4, but you can use the symbolic names if you import them from the
        Fcntl module, either individually, or as a group using the &#39;:flock&#39; tag.
        LOCK_SH requests a shared lock, LOCK_EX requests an exclusive lock, and
        LOCK_UN releases a previously requested lock. If LOCK_NB is
        bitwise-or&#39;ed with LOCK_SH or LOCK_EX then
        <span class="Li">&#34;flock&#34;</span> will return immediately rather
        than blocking waiting for the lock (check the return status to see if
        you got it).</p>
    <p class="Pp">To avoid the possibility of miscoordination, Perl now flushes
        FILEHANDLE before locking or unlocking it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the emulation built with <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/lockf.3.en.html">lockf(3)</a> doesn&#39;t
        provide shared locks, and it requires that FILEHANDLE be open with write
        intent. These are the semantics that <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/lockf.3.en.html">lockf(3)</a> implements. Most if
        not all systems implement <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/lockf.3.en.html">lockf(3)</a> in terms of <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/fcntl.2.en.html">fcntl(2)</a>
        locking, though, so the differing semantics shouldn&#39;t bite too many
        people.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/fcntl.2.en.html">fcntl(2)</a> emulation of <i>flock</i>(3)
        requires that FILEHANDLE be open with read intent to use LOCK_SH and
        requires that it be open with write intent to use LOCK_EX.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note also that some versions of
        <span class="Li">&#34;flock&#34;</span> cannot lock things over the
        network; you would need to use the more system-specific
        <span class="Li">&#34;fcntl&#34;</span> for that. If you like you can
        force Perl to ignore your system&#39;s <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/flock.2.en.html">flock(2)</a> function, and so
        provide its own <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/fcntl.2.en.html">fcntl(2)</a>-based emulation, by passing the switch
        <span class="Li">&#34;-Ud_flock&#34;</span> to the <i>Configure</i>
        program when you configure perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here&#39;s a mailbox appender for BSD systems.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Fcntl &#39;:flock&#39;; # import LOCK_* constants

    <p class="Pp">On systems that support a real <i>flock()</i>, locks are
        inherited across <i>fork()</i> calls, whereas those that must resort to
        the more capricious <i>fcntl()</i> function lose the locks, making it
        harder to write servers.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt>fork</dt>
  <dd>Does a <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/fork.2.en.html">fork(2)</a> system call to create a new process running the same
      program at the same point. It returns the child pid to the parent process,
      <span class="Li">0</span> to the child process, or
      <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> if the fork is unsuccessful.
      File descriptors (and sometimes locks on those descriptors) are shared,
      while everything else is copied. On most systems supporting <i>fork()</i>,
      great care has gone into making it extremely efficient (for example, using
      copy-on-write technology on data pages), making it the dominant paradigm
      for multitasking over the last few decades.
    <p class="Pp">Beginning with v5.6.0, Perl will attempt to flush all files
        opened for output before forking the child process, but this may not be
        supported on some platforms (see perlport). To be safe, you may need to
        set <span class="Li">$⎪</span> ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or call
        the <span class="Li">&#34;autoflush()&#34;</span> method of
        <span class="Li">&#34;IO::Handle&#34;</span> on any open handles in
        order to avoid duplicate output.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you <span class="Li">&#34;fork&#34;</span> without ever
        waiting on your children, you will accumulate zombies. On some systems,
        you can avoid this by setting <span class="Li">$SIG{CHLD}</span> to
        <span class="Li">&#34;IGNORE&#34;</span>. See also perlipc for more
        examples of forking and reaping moribund children.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if your forked child inherits system file
        descriptors like STDIN and STDOUT that are actually connected by a pipe
        or socket, even if you exit, then the remote server (such as, say, a CGI
        script or a backgrounded job launched from a remote shell) won&#39;t think
        you&#39;re done. You should reopen those to <i>/dev/null</i> if it&#39;s any
        issue.</p>

  <dt>format</dt>
  <dd>Declare a picture format for use by the

  <dt>formline PICTURE,LIST</dt>
  <dd>This is an internal function used by

      It formats (see perlform) a list of values according to the contents of
      PICTURE, placing the output into the format output accumulator,
      <span class="Li">$^A</span> (or <span class="Li">$ACCUMULATOR</span> in

      done, the contents of <span class="Li">$^A</span> are written to some
      filehandle, but you could also read <span class="Li">$^A</span> yourself
      and then set <span class="Li">$^A</span> back to
      <span class="Li">&#34;&#34;</span>. Note that a format typically does
      one <span class="Li">&#34;formline&#34;</span> per line of form, but the
      <span class="Li">&#34;formline&#34;</span> function itself doesn&#39;t care
      how many newlines are embedded in the PICTURE. This means that the
      <span class="Li">&#34;~&#34;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&#34;~~&#34;</span> tokens will treat the entire
      PICTURE as a single line. You may therefore need to use multiple formlines
      to implement a single record format, just like the format compiler.
    <p class="Pp">Be careful if you put double quotes around the picture,
        because an <span class="Li">&#34;@&#34;</span> character may be taken
        to mean the beginning of an array name.
        <span class="Li">&#34;formline&#34;</span> always returns true. See
        perlform for other examples.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>getc FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>getc</dt>
  <dd>Returns the next character from the input file attached to FILEHANDLE, or
      the undefined value at end of file, or if there was an error (in the
      latter case <span class="Li">$!</span> is set). If FILEHANDLE is omitted,
      reads from STDIN. This is not particularly efficient. However, it cannot
      be used by itself to fetch single characters without waiting for the user
      to hit enter. For that, try something more like:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if ($BSD_STYLE) {
        system &#34;stty cbreak &lt;/dev/tty &gt;/dev/tty 2&gt;&amp;1&#34;;

    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $key = getc(STDIN);

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if ($BSD_STYLE) {

    }
    else {
        system &#34;stty&#34;, &#39;icanon&#39;, &#39;eol&#39;, &#39;^@&#39;; # ASCII null
    }
    print &#34;\n&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Determination of whether <span class="Li">$BSD_STYLE</span>
        should be set is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&#34;POSIX::getattr&#34;</span>
        function can do this more portably on systems purporting POSIX
        compliance. See also the
        <span class="Li">&#34;Term::ReadKey&#34;</span> module from your
        nearest CPAN site; details on CPAN can be found on &#34;CPAN&#34; in

  </dd>
  <dt>getlogin</dt>
  <dd>Implements the C library function of the same name, which on most systems
      returns the current login from <i>/etc/utmp</i>, if any. If null, use
      <span class="Li">&#34;getpwuid&#34;</span>.
    <p class="Pp"></p>

  </dd>
  <dt>getpgrp PID</dt>
  <dd>Returns the current process group for the specified PID. Use a PID of

      current process. Note that the POSIX version of
      <span class="Li">&#34;getpgrp&#34;</span> does not accept a PID
      argument, so only <span class="Li">&#34;PID==0&#34;</span> is truly

  <dt>getppid</dt>
  <dd>Returns the process id of the parent process.
    <p class="Pp">Note for Linux users: on Linux, the C functions
        <span class="Li">&#34;getpid()&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;getppid()&#34;</span> return different values

        reflected by the perl-level function
        <span class="Li">&#34;getppid()&#34;</span>, that returns a consistent
        value across threads. If you want to call the underlying

  <dd>These routines perform the same functions as their counterparts in the
      system library. In list context, the return values from the various get
      routines are as follows:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($name,$passwd,$uid,$gid,
       $quota,$comment,$gcos,$dir,$shell,$expire) = getpw*
    ($name,$passwd,$gid,$members) = getgr*
    ($name,$aliases,$addrtype,$length,@addrs) = gethost*
    ($name,$aliases,$addrtype,$net) = getnet*
    ($name,$aliases,$proto) = getproto*
    ($name,$aliases,$port,$proto) = getserv*
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(If the entry doesn&#39;t exist you get a null list.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The exact meaning of the <span class="Li">$gcos</span> field
        varies but it usually contains the real name of the user (as opposed to
        the login name) and other information pertaining to the user. Beware,
        however, that in many system users are able to change this information
        and therefore it cannot be trusted and therefore the
        <span class="Li">$gcos</span> is tainted (see perlsec). The
        <span class="Li">$passwd</span> and <span class="Li">$shell</span>,
        user&#39;s encrypted password and login shell, are also tainted, because of
        the same reason.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, you get the name, unless the function was a
        lookup by name, in which case you get the other thing, whatever it is.
        (If the entry doesn&#39;t exist you get the undefined value.) For
      example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $uid   = getpwnam($name);
    $name  = getpwuid($num);
    $name  = getpwent();
    $gid   = getgrnam($name);
    $name  = getgrgid($num);
    $name  = getgrent();
    #etc.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In <i>getpw*()</i> the fields <span class="Li">$quota</span>,
        <span class="Li">$comment</span>, and <span class="Li">$expire</span>
        are special cases in the sense that in many systems they are
        unsupported. If the <span class="Li">$quota</span> is unsupported, it is
        an empty scalar. If it is supported, it usually encodes the disk quota.
        If the <span class="Li">$comment</span> field is unsupported, it is an
        empty scalar. If it is supported it usually encodes some administrative
        comment about the user. In some systems the
        <span class="Li">$quota</span> field may be
        <span class="Li">$change</span> or <span class="Li">$age</span>, fields
        that have to do with password aging. In some systems the
        <span class="Li">$comment</span> field may be
        <span class="Li">$class</span>. The <span class="Li">$expire</span>
        field, if present, encodes the expiration period of the account or the
        password. For the availability and the exact meaning of these fields in
        your system, please consult your <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/getpwnam.3.en.html">getpwnam(3)</a> documentation and
        your <i>pwd.h</i> file. You can also find out from within Perl what your
        <span class="Li">$quota</span> and <span class="Li">$comment</span>
        fields mean and whether you have the <span class="Li">$expire</span>
        field by using the <span class="Li">&#34;Config&#34;</span> module and
        the values <span class="Li">&#34;d_pwquota&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;d_pwage&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;d_pwchange&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;d_pwcomment&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;d_pwexpire&#34;</span>. Shadow password files
        are only supported if your vendor has implemented them in the intuitive
        fashion that calling the regular C library routines gets the shadow
        versions if you&#39;re running under privilege or if there exists the
        <a href="../../buster/manpages-ja-dev/shadow.3.ja.html">shadow(3)</a> functions as found in System V ( this includes Solaris
        and Linux.) Those systems which implement a proprietary shadow password
        facility are unlikely to be supported.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$members</span> value returned by
        <i>getgr*()</i> is a space separated list of the login names of the
        members of the group.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For the <i>gethost*()</i> functions, if the
        <span class="Li">&#34;h_errno&#34;</span> variable is supported in C,
        it will be returned to you via <span class="Li">$?</span> if the
        function call fails. The <span class="Li">@addrs</span> value returned
        by a successful call is a list of the raw addresses returned by the
        corresponding system library call. In the Internet domain, each address
        is four bytes long and you can unpack it by saying something like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($a,$b,$c,$d) = unpack(&#39;C4&#39;,$addr[0]);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The Socket library makes this slightly easier:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Socket;
    $iaddr = inet_aton(&#34;127.1&#34;); # or whatever address
    $name  = gethostbyaddr($iaddr, AF_INET);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # or going the other way
    $straddr = inet_ntoa($iaddr);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you get tired of remembering which element of the return
        list contains which return value, by-name interfaces are provided in
        standard modules: <span class="Li">&#34;File::stat&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;Net::hostent&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;Net::netent&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;Net::protoent&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;Net::servent&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;Time::gmtime&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;Time::localtime&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;User::grent&#34;</span>. These override the
        normal built-ins, supplying versions that return objects with the
        appropriate names for each field. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   use File::stat;
   use User::pwent;
   $is_his = (stat($filename)-&gt;uid == pwent($whoever)-&gt;uid);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Even though it looks like they&#39;re the same method calls (uid),
        they aren&#39;t, because a <span class="Li">&#34;File::stat&#34;</span>
        object is different from a
        <span class="Li">&#34;User::pwent&#34;</span> object.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>getsockname SOCKET</dt>
  <dd>Returns the packed sockaddr address of this end of the SOCKET connection,
      in case you don&#39;t know the address because you have several different IPs
      that the connection might have come in on.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Socket;
    $mysockaddr = getsockname(SOCK);
    ($port, $myaddr) = sockaddr_in($mysockaddr);
    printf &#34;Connect to %s [%s]\n&#34;,
       scalar gethostbyaddr($myaddr, AF_INET),
       inet_ntoa($myaddr);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>getsockopt SOCKET,LEVEL,OPTNAME</dt>
  <dd>Returns the socket option requested, or undef if there is an error.</dd>
  <dt>glob EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>glob</dt>
  <dd>In list context, returns a (possibly empty) list of filename expansions on
      the value of EXPR such as the standard Unix shell <i>/bin/csh</i> would
      do. In scalar context, glob iterates through such filename expansions,
      returning undef when the list is exhausted. This is the internal function
      implementing the <span class="Li">&#34;&lt;*.c&gt;&#34;</span> operator,
      but you can use it directly. If EXPR is omitted,
      <span class="Li">$_</span> is used. The
      <span class="Li">&#34;&lt;*.c&gt;&#34;</span> operator is discussed in
      more detail in &#34;I/O Operators&#34; in perlop.
    <p class="Pp">Beginning with v5.6.0, this operator is implemented using the
        standard <span class="Li">&#34;File::Glob&#34;</span> extension. See
        File::Glob for details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>gmtime EXPR</dt>
  <dd>Converts a time as returned by the time function to an 8-element list with
      the time localized for the standard Greenwich time zone. Typically used as
      follows:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    #  0    1    2     3     4    5     6     7
    ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday) =
                                            gmtime(time);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">All list elements are numeric, and come straight out of the C
        `struct tm&#39;. <span class="Li">$sec</span>, <span class="Li">$min</span>,
        and <span class="Li">$hour</span> are the seconds, minutes, and hours of
        the specified time. <span class="Li">$mday</span> is the day of the
        month, and <span class="Li">$mon</span> is the month itself, in the
        range <span class="Li">0..11</span> with 0 indicating January and 11
        indicating December. <span class="Li">$year</span> is the number of
        years since 1900. That is, <span class="Li">$year</span> is
        <span class="Li">123</span> in year 2023. <span class="Li">$wday</span>
        is the day of the week, with 0 indicating Sunday and 3 indicating
        Wednesday. <span class="Li">$yday</span> is the day of the year, in the
        range <span class="Li">0..364</span> (or <span class="Li">0..365</span>
        in leap years.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the <span class="Li">$year</span> element is
        <i>not</i> simply the last two digits of the year. If you assume it is,
        then you create non-Y2K-compliant programs--and you wouldn&#39;t want to do
        that, would you?</p>
    <p class="Pp">The proper way to get a complete 4-digit year is simply:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        $year += 1900;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">And to get the last two digits of the year (e.g., &#39;01&#39; in
        2001) do:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        $year = sprintf(&#34;%02d&#34;, $year % 100);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is omitted,
        <span class="Li">&#34;gmtime()&#34;</span> uses the current time

    <p class="Pp">In scalar context,

    <p class="Pp">This scalar value is <b>not</b> locale dependent (see

        POSIX module. To get somewhat similar but locale dependent date strings,
        set up your locale environment variables appropriately (please see

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use POSIX qw(strftime);

  <dt>goto LABEL</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>goto EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>goto &amp;NAME</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&#34;goto-LABEL&#34;</span> form finds the
      statement labeled with LABEL and resumes execution there. It may not be
      used to go into any construct that requires initialization, such as a
      subroutine or a <span class="Li">&#34;foreach&#34;</span> loop. It also
      can&#39;t be used to go into a construct that is optimized away, or to get out
      of a block or subroutine given to
      <span class="Li">&#34;sort&#34;</span>. It can be used to go almost
      anywhere else within the dynamic scope, including out of subroutines, but
      it&#39;s usually better to use some other construct such as
      <span class="Li">&#34;last&#34;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span>. The author of Perl has never felt
      the need to use this form of <span class="Li">&#34;goto&#34;</span> (in
      Perl, that is--C is another matter). (The difference being that C does not
      offer named loops combined with loop control. Perl does, and this replaces
      most structured uses of <span class="Li">&#34;goto&#34;</span> in other
      languages.)
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&#34;goto-EXPR&#34;</span> form expects
        a label name, whose scope will be resolved dynamically. This allows for
        computed <span class="Li">&#34;goto&#34;</span>s per FORTRAN, but
        isn&#39;t necessarily recommended if you&#39;re optimizing for
      maintainability:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    goto (&#34;FOO&#34;, &#34;BAR&#34;, &#34;GLARCH&#34;)[$i];

    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&#34;goto-&amp;NAME&#34;</span> form is
        quite different from the other forms of
        <span class="Li">&#34;goto&#34;</span>. In fact, it isn&#39;t a goto in
        the normal sense at all, and doesn&#39;t have the stigma associated with
        other gotos. Instead, it exits the current subroutine (losing any
        changes set by <i>local()</i>) and immediately calls in its place the
        named subroutine using the current value of <span class="Li">@_</span>.
        This is used by <span class="Li">&#34;AUTOLOAD&#34;</span> subroutines
        that wish to load another subroutine and then pretend that the other
        subroutine had been called in the first place (except that any
        modifications to <span class="Li">@_</span> in the current subroutine
        are propagated to the other subroutine.) After the
        <span class="Li">&#34;goto&#34;</span>, not even
        <span class="Li">&#34;caller&#34;</span> will be able to tell that
        this routine was called first.</p>
    <p class="Pp">NAME needn&#39;t be the name of a subroutine; it can be a scalar
        variable containing a code reference, or a block which evaluates to a
        code reference.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>grep BLOCK LIST</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>grep EXPR,LIST</dt>
  <dd>This is similar in spirit to, but not the same as, <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/grep.1.zh_CN.html">grep(1)</a> and its
      relatives. In particular, it is not limited to using regular expressions.
    <p class="Pp">Evaluates the BLOCK or EXPR for each element of LIST (locally
        setting <span class="Li">$_</span> to each element) and returns the list
        value consisting of those elements for which the expression evaluated to
        true. In scalar context, returns the number of times the expression was
        true.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @foo = grep(!/^#/, @bar);    # weed out comments
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or equivalently,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @foo = grep {!/^#/} @bar;    # weed out comments
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">$_</span> is an alias to the list
        value, so it can be used to modify the elements of the LIST. While this
        is useful and supported, it can cause bizarre results if the elements of
        LIST are not variables. Similarly, grep returns aliases into the
        original list, much as a for loop&#39;s index variable aliases the list
        elements. That is, modifying an element of a list returned by grep (for
        example, in a <span class="Li">&#34;foreach&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;map&#34;</span> or another
        <span class="Li">&#34;grep&#34;</span>) actually modifies the element
        in the original list. This is usually something to be avoided when
        writing clear code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also &#34;map&#34; for a list composed of the results of
        the BLOCK or EXPR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>hex EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>hex</dt>
  <dd>Interprets EXPR as a hex string and returns the corresponding value. (To
      convert strings that might start with either 0, 0x, or 0b, see
      &#34;oct&#34;.) If EXPR is omitted, uses <span class="Li">$_</span>.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print hex &#39;0xAf&#39;; # prints &#39;175&#39;
    print hex &#39;aF&#39;;   # same
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Hex strings may only represent integers. Strings that would
        cause integer overflow trigger a warning. Leading whitespace is not
        stripped, unlike <i>oct()</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>import</dt>
  <dd>There is no builtin <span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> function.
      It is just an ordinary method (subroutine) defined (or inherited) by
      modules that wish to export names to another module. The
      <span class="Li">&#34;use&#34;</span> function calls the
      <span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> method for the package used.
      See also &#34;use&#34;, perlmod, and Exporter.</dd>
  <dt>index STR,SUBSTR,POSITION</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>index STR,SUBSTR</dt>
  <dd>The index function searches for one string within another, but without the
      wildcard-like behavior of a full regular-expression pattern match. It
      returns the position of the first occurrence of SUBSTR in STR at or after
      POSITION. If POSITION is omitted, starts searching from the beginning of
      the string. The return value is based at <span class="Li">0</span> (or
      whatever you&#39;ve set the <span class="Li">$[</span> variable to--but don&#39;t
      do that). If the substring is not found, returns one less than the base,
      ordinarily <span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>int EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>int</dt>
  <dd>Returns the integer portion of EXPR. If EXPR is omitted, uses
      <span class="Li">$_</span>. You should not use this function for rounding:
      one because it truncates towards <span class="Li">0</span>, and two
      because machine representations of floating point numbers can sometimes
      produce counterintuitive results. For example,
      <span class="Li">&#34;int(-6.725/0.025)&#34;</span> produces -268 rather
      than the correct -269; that&#39;s because it&#39;s really more like
      -268.99999999999994315658 instead. Usually, the
      <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;printf&#34;</span>, or the
      <span class="Li">&#34;POSIX::floor&#34;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&#34;POSIX::ceil&#34;</span> functions will serve you
      better than will <i>int()</i>.</dd>
  <dt>ioctl FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR</dt>
  <dd>Implements the <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/ioctl.2.en.html">ioctl(2)</a> function. You&#39;ll probably first have to say
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    require &#34;ioctl.ph&#34;; # probably in /usr/local/lib/perl/ioctl.ph
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">to get the correct function definitions. If <i>ioctl.ph</i>
        doesn&#39;t exist or doesn&#39;t have the correct definitions you&#39;ll have to
        roll your own, based on your C header files such as
        <i>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</i>. (There is a Perl script called <b>h2ph</b>
        that comes with the Perl kit that may help you in this, but it&#39;s
        nontrivial.) SCALAR will be read and/or written depending on the
        FUNCTION--a pointer to the string value of SCALAR will be passed as the
        third argument of the actual <span class="Li">&#34;ioctl&#34;</span>
        call. (If SCALAR has no string value but does have a numeric value, that
        value will be passed rather than a pointer to the string value. To
        guarantee this to be true, add a <span class="Li">0</span> to the scalar
        before using it.) The <span class="Li">&#34;pack&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;unpack&#34;</span> functions may be needed to
        manipulate the values of structures used by
        <span class="Li">&#34;ioctl&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The return value of <span class="Li">&#34;ioctl&#34;</span>
        (and <span class="Li">&#34;fcntl&#34;</span>) is as follows:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        if OS returns:          then Perl returns:
            -1                    undefined value
             0                  string &#34;0 but true&#34;
        anything else               that number
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Thus Perl returns true on success and false on failure, yet
        you can still easily determine the actual value returned by the
        operating system:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $retval = ioctl(...) ⎪⎪ -1;
    printf &#34;System returned %d\n&#34;, $retval;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The special string &#34;<span class="Li">0</span> but
        true&#34; is exempt from <b>-w</b> complaints about improper numeric
        conversions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here&#39;s an example of setting a filehandle named
        <span class="Li">&#34;REMOTE&#34;</span> to be non-blocking at the
        system level. You&#39;ll have to negotiate <span class="Li">$⎪</span>
        on your own, though.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Fcntl qw(F_GETFL F_SETFL O_NONBLOCK);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $flags = fcntl(REMOTE, F_GETFL, 0)
                or die &#34;Can&#39;t get flags for the socket: $!\n&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $flags = fcntl(REMOTE, F_SETFL, $flags ⎪ O_NONBLOCK)
                or die &#34;Can&#39;t set flags for the socket: $!\n&#34;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>join EXPR,LIST</dt>
  <dd>Joins the separate strings of LIST into a single string with fields
      separated by the value of EXPR, and returns that new string. Example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $rec = join(&#39;:&#39;, $login,$passwd,$uid,$gid,$gcos,$home,$shell);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Beware that unlike <span class="Li">&#34;split&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;join&#34;</span> doesn&#39;t take a pattern as its
        first argument. Compare &#34;split&#34;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>keys HASH</dt>
  <dd>Returns a list consisting of all the keys of the named hash. (In scalar
      context, returns the number of keys.)
    <p class="Pp">The keys are returned in an apparently random order. The
        actual random order is subject to change in future versions of perl, but
        it is guaranteed to be the same order as either the
        <span class="Li">&#34;values&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;each&#34;</span> function produces (given that
        the hash has not been modified). Since Perl 5.8.1 the ordering is
        different even between different runs of Perl for security reasons (see
        &#34;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&#34; in perlsec).</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a side effect, calling <i>keys()</i> resets the HASH&#39;s
        internal iterator, see &#34;each&#34;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here is yet another way to print your environment:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @keys = keys %ENV;
    @values = values %ENV;
    while (@keys) {
        print pop(@keys), &#39;=&#39;, pop(@values), &#34;\n&#34;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or how about sorted by key:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    foreach $key (sort(keys %ENV)) {
        print $key, &#39;=&#39;, $ENV{$key}, &#34;\n&#34;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The returned values are copies of the original keys in the
        hash, so modifying them will not affect the original hash. Compare
        &#34;values&#34;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To sort a hash by value, you&#39;ll need to use a
        <span class="Li">&#34;sort&#34;</span> function. Here&#39;s a descending
        numeric sort of a hash by its values:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    foreach $key (sort { $hash{$b} &lt;=&gt; $hash{$a} } keys %hash) {
        printf &#34;%4d %s\n&#34;, $hash{$key}, $key;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As an lvalue <span class="Li">&#34;keys&#34;</span> allows
        you to increase the number of hash buckets allocated for the given hash.
        This can gain you a measure of efficiency if you know the hash is going
        to get big. (This is similar to pre-extending an array by assigning a
        larger number to $#array.) If you say</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    keys %hash = 200;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then <span class="Li">%hash</span> will have at least 200
        buckets allocated for it--256 of them, in fact, since it rounds up to
        the next power of two. These buckets will be retained even if you do
        <span class="Li">&#34;%hash = ()&#34;</span>, use
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef</span> <span class="Li">%hash&#34;</span>
        if you want to free the storage while <span class="Li">%hash</span> is
        still in scope. You can&#39;t shrink the number of buckets allocated for the
        hash using <span class="Li">&#34;keys&#34;</span> in this way (but you
        needn&#39;t worry about doing this by accident, as trying has no
      effect).</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <span class="Li">&#34;each&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;values&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;sort&#34;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>kill SIGNAL, LIST</dt>
  <dd>Sends a signal to a list of processes. Returns the number of processes
      successfully signaled (which is not necessarily the same as the number
      actually killed).
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $cnt = kill 1, $child1, $child2;
    kill 9, @goners;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If SIGNAL is zero, no signal is sent to the process. This is a
        useful way to check that a child process is alive and hasn&#39;t changed its
        UID. See perlport for notes on the portability of this construct.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unlike in the shell, if SIGNAL is negative, it kills process
        groups instead of processes. (On System V, a negative <i>PROCESS</i>
        number will also kill process groups, but that&#39;s not portable.) That
        means you usually want to use positive not negative signals. You may
        also use a signal name in quotes.</p>

  <dt>length EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>length</dt>
  <dd>Returns the length in <i>characters</i> of the value of EXPR. If EXPR is

    <p class="Pp">Note the <i>characters</i>: if the EXPR is in Unicode, you

    <p class="Pp">This scalar value is <b>not</b> locale dependent, see

  <dt>lock THING</dt>
  <dd>This function places an advisory lock on a shared variable, or referenced
      object contained in <i>THING</i> until the lock goes out of scope.
    <p class="Pp"><i>lock()</i> is a &#34;weak keyword&#34; : this means that
        if you&#39;ve defined a function by this name (before any calls to it), that
        function will be called instead. (However, if you&#39;ve said
        <span class="Li">&#34;use threads&#34;</span>, <i>lock()</i> is always

  <dt>log EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>log</dt>
  <dd>Returns the natural logarithm (base <i>e</i>) of EXPR. If EXPR is omitted,
      returns log of <span class="Li">$_</span>. To get the log of another base,
      use basic algebra: The base-N log of a number is equal to the natural log
      of that number divided by the natural log of N. For example:

  <dt>map EXPR,LIST</dt>
  <dd>Evaluates the BLOCK or EXPR for each element of LIST (locally setting

      composed of the results of each such evaluation. In scalar context,
      returns the total number of elements so generated. Evaluates BLOCK or EXPR
      in list context, so each element of LIST may produce zero, one, or more
      elements in the returned value.

  <dt>mkdir FILENAME</dt>
  <dd>Creates the directory specified by FILENAME, with permissions specified by
      MASK (as modified by <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span>). If it
      succeeds it returns true, otherwise it returns false and sets
      <span class="Li">$!</span> (errno). If omitted, MASK defaults to 0777.
    <p class="Pp">In general, it is better to create directories with permissive
        MASK, and let the user modify that with their
        <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span>, than it is to supply a
        restrictive MASK and give the user no way to be more permissive. The
        exceptions to this rule are when the file or directory should be kept
        private (mail files, for instance). The <a href="../../buster/perl-doc/perlfunc.1.en.html">perlfunc(1)</a> entry on
        <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span> discusses the choice of MASK
        in more detail.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that according to the POSIX 1003.1-1996 the FILENAME may
        have any number of trailing slashes. Some operating and filesystems do
        not get this right, so Perl automatically removes all trailing slashes

  <dt>msgrcv ID,VAR,SIZE,TYPE,FLAGS</dt>
  <dd>Calls the System V IPC function msgrcv to receive a message from message
      queue ID into variable VAR with a maximum message size of SIZE. Note that
      when a message is received, the message type as a native long integer will
      be the first thing in VAR, followed by the actual message. This packing
      may be opened with <span class="Li">&#34;unpack(&#34;l!
      a*&#34;)&#34;</span>. Taints the variable. Returns true if successful,

  <dt>msgsnd ID,MSG,FLAGS</dt>
  <dd>Calls the System V IPC function msgsnd to send the message MSG to the

      type, and be followed by the length of the actual message, and finally the
      message itself. This kind of packing can be achieved with
      <span class="Li">&#34;pack(&#34;l! a*&#34;, $type,
      $message)&#34;</span>. Returns true if successful, or false if there is

  <dd>Opens the file whose filename is given by EXPR, and associates it with
      FILEHANDLE.
    <p class="Pp">(The following is a comprehensive reference to <i>open()</i>:
        for a gentler introduction you may consider perlopentut.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If FILEHANDLE is an undefined scalar variable (or array or
        hash element) the variable is assigned a reference to a new anonymous
        filehandle, otherwise if FILEHANDLE is an expression, its value is used
        as the name of the real filehandle wanted. (This is considered a
        symbolic reference, so <span class="Li">&#34;use strict
        &#39;refs&#39;&#34;</span> should <i>not</i> be in effect.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is omitted, the scalar variable of the same name as
        the FILEHANDLE contains the filename. (Note that lexical
        variables--those declared with
        <span class="Li">&#34;my&#34;</span>--will not work for this purpose;
        so if you&#39;re using <span class="Li">&#34;my&#34;</span>, specify EXPR
        in your call to open.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If three or more arguments are specified then the mode of
        opening and the file name are separate. If MODE is
        <span class="Li">&#39;&lt;&#39;</span> or nothing, the file is opened for input.
        If MODE is <span class="Li">&#39;&gt;&#39;</span>, the file is truncated and
        opened for output, being created if necessary. If MODE is
        <span class="Li">&#39;&gt;&gt;&#39;</span>, the file is opened for appending,
        again being created if necessary.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can put a <span class="Li">&#39;+&#39;</span> in front of the
        <span class="Li">&#39;&gt;&#39;</span> or <span class="Li">&#39;&lt;&#39;</span> to
        indicate that you want both read and write access to the file; thus
        <span class="Li">&#39;+&lt;&#39;</span> is almost always preferred for
        read/write updates--the <span class="Li">&#39;+&gt;&#39;</span> mode would
        clobber the file first. You can&#39;t usually use either read-write mode for
        updating textfiles, since they have variable length records. See the
        <b>-i</b> switch in perlrun for a better approach. The file is created
        with permissions of <span class="Li">0666</span> modified by the
        process&#39; <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span> value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These various prefixes correspond to the <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/fopen.3.zh_CN.html">fopen(3)</a> modes
        of <span class="Li">&#39;r&#39;</span>, <span class="Li">&#39;r+&#39;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#39;w&#39;</span>, <span class="Li">&#39;w+&#39;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#39;a&#39;</span>, and <span class="Li">&#39;a+&#39;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In the 2-arguments (and 1-argument) form of the call the mode
        and filename should be concatenated (in this order), possibly separated
        by spaces. It is possible to omit the mode in these forms if the mode is
        <span class="Li">&#39;&lt;&#39;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the filename begins with
        <span class="Li">&#39;⎪&#39;</span>, the filename is interpreted as a
        command to which output is to be piped, and if the filename ends with a
        <span class="Li">&#39;⎪&#39;</span>, the filename is interpreted as a
        command which pipes output to us. See &#34;Using <i>open()</i> for
        IPC&#34; in perlipc for more examples of this. (You are not allowed to
        <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> to a command that pipes both in
        <i>and</i> out, but see IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3, and &#34;Bidirectional
        Communication with Another Process&#34; in perlipc for
      alternatives.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">For three or more arguments if MODE is
        <span class="Li">&#39;⎪-&#39;</span>, the filename is interpreted as a
        command to which output is to be piped, and if MODE is
        <span class="Li">&#39;-⎪&#39;</span>, the filename is interpreted as a
        command which pipes output to us. In the 2-arguments (and 1-argument)
        form one should replace dash (<span class="Li">&#39;-&#39;</span>) with the
        command. See &#34;Using <i>open()</i> for IPC&#34; in perlipc for more
        examples of this. (You are not allowed to
        <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> to a command that pipes both in
        <i>and</i> out, but see IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3, and &#34;Bidirectional
        Communication&#34; in perlipc for alternatives.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">In the three-or-more argument form of pipe opens, if LIST is
        specified (extra arguments after the command name) then LIST becomes
        arguments to the command invoked if the platform supports it. The
        meaning of <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> with more than three
        arguments for non-pipe modes is not yet specified. Experimental
        &#34;layers&#34; may give extra LIST arguments meaning.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In the 2-arguments (and 1-argument) form opening
        <span class="Li">&#39;-&#39;</span> opens STDIN and opening
        <span class="Li">&#39;&gt;-&#39;</span> opens STDOUT.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may use the three-argument form of open to specify IO
        &#34;layers&#34; (sometimes also referred to as
        &#34;disciplines&#34;) to be applied to the handle that affect how the
        input and output are processed (see open and PerlIO for more details).
        For example</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  open(FH, &#34;&lt;:utf8&#34;, &#34;file&#34;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will open the UTF-8 encoded file containing Unicode
        characters, see perluniintro. (Note that if layers are specified in the
        three-arg form then default layers set by the
        <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> pragma are ignored.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Open returns nonzero upon success, the undefined value
        otherwise. If the <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> involved a
        pipe, the return value happens to be the pid of the subprocess.</p>

        and those that don&#39;t is their text file formats. Systems like Unix, Mac
        OS, and Plan 9, which delimit lines with a single character, and which
        encode that character in C as <span class="Li">&#34;\n&#34;</span>, do
        not need <span class="Li">&#34;binmode&#34;</span>. The rest need
      it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When opening a file, it&#39;s usually a bad idea to continue
        normal execution if the request failed, so
        <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> is frequently used in
        connection with <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span>. Even if
        <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span> won&#39;t do what you want (say, in
        a CGI script, where you want to make a nicely formatted error message
        (but there are modules that can help with that problem)) you should
        always check the return value from opening a file. The infrequent
        exception is when working with an unopened filehandle is actually what
        you want to do.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a special case the 3 arg form with a read/write mode and
        the third argument being <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(TMP, &#34;+&gt;&#34;, undef) or die ...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">opens a filehandle to an anonymous temporary file. Also using
        &#34;+&lt;&#34; works for symmetry, but you really should consider
        writing something to the temporary file first. You will need to
        <i>seek()</i> to do the reading.</p>
    <p class="Pp">File handles can be opened to &#34;in memory&#34; files held
        in Perl scalars via:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open($fh, &#39;&gt;&#39;, \$variable) ⎪⎪ ..

    <p class="Pp">Though if you try to re-open
        <span class="Li">&#34;STDOUT&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;STDERR&#34;</span> as an &#34;in memory&#34;
        file, you have to close it first:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

    <p class="Pp">You may also, in the Bourne shell tradition, specify an EXPR
        beginning with <span class="Li">&#39;&gt;&amp;&#39;</span>, in which case the
        rest of the string is interpreted as the name of a filehandle (or file
        descriptor, if numeric) to be duped (as <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/dup.2.en.html">dup(2)</a>) and opened. You
        may use <span class="Li">&#34;&amp;&#34;</span> after
        <span class="Li">&#34;&gt;&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;&gt;&gt;&#34;</span>,

        <span class="Li">&#34;+&gt;&gt;&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;+&lt;&#34;</span>. The mode you specify should
        match the mode of the original filehandle. (Duping a filehandle does not
        take into account any existing contents of IO buffers.) If you use the 3
        arg form then you can pass either a number, the name of a filehandle or
        the normal &#34;reference to a glob&#34;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here is a script that saves, redirects, and restores
        <span class="Li">&#34;STDOUT&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;STDERR&#34;</span> using various methods:</p>

    <p class="Pp">If you specify <span class="Li">&#39;&lt;&amp;=X&#39;</span>, where
        <span class="Li">&#34;X&#34;</span> is a file descriptor number or a
        filehandle, then Perl will do an equivalent of C&#39;s
        <span class="Li">&#34;fdopen&#34;</span> of that file descriptor (and
        not call <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/dup.2.en.html">dup(2)</a>); this is more parsimonious of file descriptors.
        For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # open for input, reusing the fileno of $fd
    open(FILEHANDLE, &#34;&lt;&amp;=$fd&#34;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(FILEHANDLE, &#34;&lt;&amp;=&#34;, $fd)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # open for append, using the fileno of OLDFH
    open(FH, &#34;&gt;&gt;&amp;=&#34;, OLDFH)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(FH, &#34;&gt;&gt;&amp;=OLDFH&#34;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Being parsimonious on filehandles is also useful (besides
        being parsimonious) for example when something is dependent on file
        descriptors, like for example locking using <i>flock()</i>. If you do
        just <span class="Li">&#34;open(A, &#39;&gt;&gt;&amp;B&#39;)&#34;</span>, the
        filehandle A will not have the same file descriptor as B, and therefore
        flock(A) will not flock(B), and vice versa. But with
        <span class="Li">&#34;open(A, &#39;&gt;&gt;&amp;=B&#39;)&#34;</span> the
        filehandles will share the same file descriptor.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if you are using Perls older than 5.8.0, Perl will
        be using the standard C libraries&#39; <i>fdopen()</i> to implement the
        &#34;=&#34; functionality. On many UNIX systems <i>fdopen()</i> fails
        when file descriptors exceed a certain value, typically 255. For Perls
        5.8.0 and later, PerlIO is most often the default.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can see whether Perl has been compiled with PerlIO or not
        by running <span class="Li">&#34;perl -V&#34;</span> and looking for
        <span class="Li">&#34;useperlio=&#34;</span> line. If
        <span class="Li">&#34;useperlio&#34;</span> is
        <span class="Li">&#34;define&#34;</span>, you have PerlIO, otherwise
        you don&#39;t.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you open a pipe on the command <span class="Li">&#39;-&#39;</span>,
        i.e., either <span class="Li">&#39;⎪-&#39;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#39;-⎪&#39;</span> with 2-arguments (or 1-argument)
        form of <i>open()</i>, then there is an implicit fork done, and the
        return value of open is the pid of the child within the parent process,
        and <span class="Li">0</span> within the child process. (Use
        <span class="Li">&#34;defined($pid)&#34;</span> to determine whether
        the open was successful.) The filehandle behaves normally for the
        parent, but i/o to that filehandle is piped from/to the STDOUT/STDIN of
        the child process. In the child process the filehandle isn&#39;t opened--i/o
        happens from/to the new STDOUT or STDIN. Typically this is used like the
        normal piped open when you want to exercise more control over just how
        the pipe command gets executed, such as when you are running setuid, and
        don&#39;t want to have to scan shell commands for metacharacters. The
        following triples are more or less equivalent:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(FOO, &#34;⎪tr &#39;[a-z]&#39; &#39;[A-Z]&#39;&#34;);
    open(FOO, &#39;⎪-&#39;, &#34;tr &#39;[a-z]&#39; &#39;[A-Z]&#39;&#34;);
    open(FOO, &#39;⎪-&#39;) ⎪⎪ exec &#39;tr&#39;, &#39;[a-z]&#39;, &#39;[A-Z]&#39;;
    open(FOO, &#39;⎪-&#39;, &#34;tr&#34;, &#39;[a-z]&#39;, &#39;[A-Z]&#39;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(FOO, &#34;cat -n &#39;$file&#39;⎪&#34;);
    open(FOO, &#39;-⎪&#39;, &#34;cat -n &#39;$file&#39;&#34;);
    open(FOO, &#39;-⎪&#39;) ⎪⎪ exec &#39;cat&#39;, &#39;-n&#39;, $file;
    open(FOO, &#39;-⎪&#39;, &#34;cat&#34;, &#39;-n&#39;, $file);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The last example in each block shows the pipe as &#34;list
        form&#34;, which is not yet supported on all platforms. A good rule of
        thumb is that if your platform has true
        <span class="Li">&#34;fork()&#34;</span> (in other words, if your
        platform is UNIX) you can use the list form.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &#34;Safe Pipe Opens&#34; in perlipc for more examples
        of this.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Beginning with v5.6.0, Perl will attempt to flush all files
        opened for output before any operation that may do a fork, but this may
        not be supported on some platforms (see perlport). To be safe, you may
        need to set <span class="Li">$⎪</span> ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or
        call the <span class="Li">&#34;autoflush()&#34;</span> method of
        <span class="Li">&#34;IO::Handle&#34;</span> on any open handles.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on files, the
        flag will be set for the newly opened file descriptor as determined by
        the value of $^F. See &#34;$^F&#34; in perlvar.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Closing any piped filehandle causes the parent process to wait
        for the child to finish, and returns the status value in
        <span class="Li">$?</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The filename passed to 2-argument (or 1-argument) form of
        <i>open()</i> will have leading and trailing whitespace deleted, and the
        normal redirection characters honored. This property, known as
        &#34;magic open&#34;, can often be used to good effect. A user could
        specify a filename of <i>&#34;rsh cat file ⎪&#34;</i>, or you
        could change certain filenames as needed:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $filename =~ s/(.*\.gz)\s*$/gzip -dc &lt; $1⎪/;
    open(FH, $filename) or die &#34;Can&#39;t open $filename: $!&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Use 3-argument form to open a file with arbitrary weird
        characters in it,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(FOO, &#39;&lt;&#39;, $file);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">otherwise it&#39;s necessary to protect any leading and trailing
        whitespace:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $file =~ s#^(\s)#./$1#;
    open(FOO, &#34;&lt; $file\0&#34;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(this may not work on some bizarre filesystems). One should
        conscientiously choose between the <i>magic</i> and 3-arguments form of
        <i>open()</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open IN, $ARGV[0];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will allow the user to specify an argument of the form
        <span class="Li">&#34;rsh cat file ⎪&#34;</span>, but will not

        system), then you should use the
        <span class="Li">&#34;sysopen&#34;</span> function, which involves no
        such magic (but may use subtly different filemodes than Perl
        <i>open()</i>, which is mapped to C <i>fopen()</i>). This is another way
        to protect your filenames from interpretation. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use IO::Handle;

        <span class="Li">&#34;IO::Socket&#34;</span>), you can generate

        variable is entered is determined at the point of the declaration, not
        at the point of use. This means the following behavior holds:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    package Foo;
    our $bar;           # declares $Foo::bar for rest of lexical scope
    $bar = 20;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    package Bar;
    print $bar;         # prints 20
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Multiple <span class="Li">&#34;our&#34;</span> declarations
        in the same lexical scope are allowed if they are in different packages.
        If they happened to be in the same package, Perl will emit warnings if
        you have asked for them.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use warnings;
    package Foo;
    our $bar;           # declares $Foo::bar for rest of lexical scope
    $bar = 20;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    package Bar;
    our $bar = 30;      # declares $Bar::bar for rest of lexical scope
    print $bar;         # prints 30
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    our $bar;           # emits warning
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">An <span class="Li">&#34;our&#34;</span> declaration may
        also have a list of attributes associated with it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The exact semantics and interface of TYPE and ATTRS are still
        evolving. TYPE is currently bound to the use of
        <span class="Li">&#34;fields&#34;</span> pragma, and attributes are
        handled using the <span class="Li">&#34;attributes&#34;</span> pragma,
        or starting from Perl 5.8.0 also via the
        <span class="Li">&#34;Attribute::Handlers&#34;</span> module. See
        &#34;Private Variables via <i>my()</i>&#34; in perlsub for details,
        and fields, attributes, and Attribute::Handlers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The only currently recognized
        <span class="Li">&#34;our()&#34;</span> attribute is
        <span class="Li">&#34;unique&#34;</span> which indicates that a single
        copy of the global is to be used by all interpreters should the program
        happen to be running in a multi-interpreter environment. (The default
        behaviour would be for each interpreter to have its own copy of the
        global.) Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    our @EXPORT : unique = qw(foo);
    our %EXPORT_TAGS : unique = (bar =&gt; [qw(aa bb cc)]);
    our $VERSION : unique = &#34;1.00&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that this attribute also has the effect of making the
        global readonly when the first new interpreter is cloned (for example,
        when the first new thread is created).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Multi-interpreter environments can come to being either
        through the <i>fork()</i> emulation on Windows platforms, or by
        embedding perl in a multi-threaded application. The
        <span class="Li">&#34;unique&#34;</span> attribute does nothing in all
        other environments.</p>

  <dt>pack TEMPLATE,LIST</dt>
  <dd>Takes a LIST of values and converts it into a string using the rules given
      by the TEMPLATE. The resulting string is the concatenation of the

      integer may be represented by a sequence of 4 bytes.

  <li>Each letter may optionally be followed by a number giving a repeat count.
      With all types except <span class="Li">&#34;a&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;A&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;Z&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;b&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;B&#34;</span>,

      <span class="Li">&#34;@&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;x&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;X&#34;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&#34;P&#34;</span> the pack function will gobble up
      that many values from the LIST. A <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span>
      for the repeat count means to use however many items are left, except for
      <span class="Li">&#34;@&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;x&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;X&#34;</span>, where it is equivalent to
      <span class="Li">0</span>, and <span class="Li">&#34;u&#34;</span>,
      where it is equivalent to 1 (or 45, what is the same). A numeric repeat
      count may optionally be enclosed in brackets, as in
      <span class="Li">&#34;pack &#39;C[80]&#39;, @arr&#34;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">One can replace the numeric repeat count by a template
        enclosed in brackets; then the packed length of this template in bytes
        is used as a count. For example,
        <span class="Li">&#34;x[L]&#34;</span> skips a long (it skips the
        number of bytes in a long); the template <span class="Li">&#34;$t X[$t]
        $t&#34;</span> <i>unpack()</i>s twice what <span class="Li">$t</span>
        unpacks. If the template in brackets contains alignment commands (such
        as <span class="Li">&#34;x![d]&#34;</span>), its packed length is
        calculated as if the start of the template has the maximal possible
        alignment.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When used with <span class="Li">&#34;Z&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span> results in the addition of a
        trailing null byte (so the packed result will be one longer than the
        byte <span class="Li">&#34;length&#34;</span> of the item).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The repeat count for <span class="Li">&#34;u&#34;</span> is
        interpreted as the maximal number of bytes to encode per line of output,
        with 0 and 1 replaced by 45.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&#34;a&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;A&#34;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&#34;Z&#34;</span> types gobble just one value, but
      pack it as a string of length count, padding with nulls or spaces as
      necessary. When unpacking, <span class="Li">&#34;A&#34;</span> strips
      trailing spaces and nulls, <span class="Li">&#34;Z&#34;</span> strips
      everything after the first null, and <span class="Li">&#34;a&#34;</span>
      returns data verbatim. When packing,
      <span class="Li">&#34;a&#34;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&#34;Z&#34;</span> are equivalent.
    <p class="Pp">If the value-to-pack is too long, it is truncated. If too long
        and an explicit count is provided, <span class="Li">&#34;Z&#34;</span>
        packs only <span class="Li">&#34;$count-1&#34;</span> bytes, followed
        by a null byte. Thus <span class="Li">&#34;Z&#34;</span> always packs
        a trailing null byte under all circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Likewise, the <span class="Li">&#34;b&#34;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&#34;B&#34;</span> fields pack a string that many bits
      long. Each byte of the input field of <i>pack()</i> generates 1 bit of the
      result. Each result bit is based on the least-significant bit of the
      corresponding input byte, i.e., on
      <span class="Li">&#34;ord($byte)%2&#34;</span>. In particular, bytes
      <span class="Li">&#34;0&#34;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&#34;1&#34;</span> generate bits 0 and 1, as do bytes
      <span class="Li">&#34;\0&#34;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&#34;\1&#34;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Starting from the beginning of the input string of
        <i>pack()</i>, each 8-tuple of bytes is converted to 1 byte of output.
        With format <span class="Li">&#34;b&#34;</span> the first byte of the
        8-tuple determines the least-significant bit of a byte, and with format
        <span class="Li">&#34;B&#34;</span> it determines the most-significant
        bit of a byte.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the length of the input string is not exactly divisible by
        8, the remainder is packed as if the input string were padded by null
        bytes at the end. Similarly, during <i>unpack()</i>ing the
        &#34;extra&#34; bits are ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the input string of <i>pack()</i> is longer than needed,
        extra bytes are ignored. A <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span> for the
        repeat count of <i>pack()</i> means to use all the bytes of the input
        field. On <i>unpack()</i>ing the bits are converted to a string of
        <span class="Li">&#34;0&#34;</span>s and
        <span class="Li">&#34;1&#34;</span>s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&#34;h&#34;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&#34;H&#34;</span> fields pack a string that many
      nybbles (4-bit groups, representable as hexadecimal digits, 0-9a-f) long.
    <p class="Pp">Each byte of the input field of <i>pack()</i> generates 4 bits
        of the result. For non-alphabetical bytes the result is based on the 4
        least-significant bits of the input byte, i.e., on
        <span class="Li">&#34;ord($byte)%16&#34;</span>. In particular, bytes
        <span class="Li">&#34;0&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;1&#34;</span> generate nybbles 0 and 1, as do
        bytes <span class="Li">&#34;\0&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;\1&#34;</span>. For bytes
        <span class="Li">&#34;a&#34;..&#34;f&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;A&#34;..&#34;F&#34;</span> the result is
        compatible with the usual hexadecimal digits, so that
        <span class="Li">&#34;a&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;A&#34;</span> both generate the nybble
        <span class="Li">&#34;0xa==10&#34;</span>. The result for bytes
        <span class="Li">&#34;g&#34;..&#34;z&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;G&#34;..&#34;Z&#34;</span> is not
        well-defined.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting from the beginning of the input string of
        <i>pack()</i>, each pair of bytes is converted to 1 byte of output. With
        format <span class="Li">&#34;h&#34;</span> the first byte of the pair
        determines the least-significant nybble of the output byte, and with
        format <span class="Li">&#34;H&#34;</span> it determines the
        most-significant nybble.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the length of the input string is not even, it behaves as
        if padded by a null byte at the end. Similarly, during
        <i>unpack()</i>ing the &#34;extra&#34; nybbles are ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the input string of <i>pack()</i> is longer than needed,
        extra bytes are ignored. A <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span> for the
        repeat count of <i>pack()</i> means to use all the bytes of the input
        field. On <i>unpack()</i>ing the bits are converted to a string of
        hexadecimal digits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&#34;p&#34;</span> type packs a pointer to a
      null-terminated string. You are responsible for ensuring the string is not
      a temporary value (which can potentially get deallocated before you get
      around to using the packed result). The
      <span class="Li">&#34;P&#34;</span> type packs a pointer to a structure
      of the size indicated by the length. A NULL pointer is created if the
      corresponding value for <span class="Li">&#34;p&#34;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&#34;P&#34;</span> is
      <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span>, similarly for
    <i>unpack()</i>.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&#34;/&#34;</span> template character allows
      packing and unpacking of strings where the packed structure contains a
      byte count followed by the string itself. You write
      <i>length-item</i><span class="Li">&#34;/&#34;</span><i>string-item</i>.
    <p class="Pp">The <i>length-item</i> can be any
        <span class="Li">&#34;pack&#34;</span> template letter, and describes
        how the length value is packed. The ones likely to be of most use are
        integer-packing ones like <span class="Li">&#34;n&#34;</span> (for
        Java strings), <span class="Li">&#34;w&#34;</span> (for ASN.1 or SNMP)
        and <span class="Li">&#34;N&#34;</span> (for Sun XDR).</p>
    <p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&#34;pack&#34;</span>, the
        <i>string-item</i> must, at present, be
        <span class="Li">&#34;A*&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;a*&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;Z*&#34;</span>. For
        <span class="Li">&#34;unpack&#34;</span> the length of the string is
        obtained from the <i>length-item</i>, but if you put in the &#39;*&#39; it will
        be ignored. For all other codes,
        <span class="Li">&#34;unpack&#34;</span> applies the length value to
        the next item, which must not have a repeat count.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    unpack &#39;C/a&#39;, &#34;\04Gurusamy&#34;;        gives &#39;Guru&#39;

  <li>The integer formats <span class="Li">&#34;s&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;S&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;i&#34;</span>,

      <span class="Li">&#34;l&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;L&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;j&#34;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&#34;J&#34;</span> are inherently non-portable between
      processors and operating systems because they obey the native byteorder
      and endianness. For example a 4-byte integer 0x12345678 (305419896
      decimal) would be ordered natively (arranged in and handled by the CPU
      registers) into bytes as
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78     # big-endian
        0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12     # little-endian
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Basically, the Intel and VAX CPUs are little-endian, while
        everybody else, for example Motorola m68k/88k, PPC, Sparc, HP PA, Power,
        and Cray are big-endian. Alpha and MIPS can be either: Digital/Compaq
        used/uses them in little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses them in big-endian
        mode.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The names `big-endian&#39; and `little-endian&#39; are comic
        references to the classic &#34;Gulliver&#39;s Travels&#34; (via the paper
        &#34;On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace&#34; by Danny Cohen, USC/ISI
        IEN 137, April 1, 1980) and the egg-eating habits of the
      Lilliputians.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some systems may have even weirder byte orders such as</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        0x56 0x78 0x12 0x34
        0x34 0x12 0x78 0x56
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can see your system&#39;s preference with</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        print join(&#34; &#34;, map { sprintf &#34;%#02x&#34;, $_ }
                            unpack(&#34;C*&#34;,pack(&#34;L&#34;,0x12345678))), &#34;\n&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The byteorder on the platform where Perl was built is also
        available via Config:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        use Config;
        print $Config{byteorder}, &#34;\n&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Byteorders <span class="Li">&#39;1234&#39;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#39;12345678&#39;</span> are little-endian,
        <span class="Li">&#39;4321&#39;</span> and <span class="Li">&#39;87654321&#39;</span>
        are big-endian.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want portable packed integers use the formats
        <span class="Li">&#34;n&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;N&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;v&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;V&#34;</span>, their byte endianness and size
        are known. See also perlport.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Real numbers (floats and doubles) are in the native machine format only;
      due to the multiplicity of floating formats around, and the lack of a
      standard &#34;network&#34; representation, no facility for interchange
      has been made. This means that packed floating point data written on one
      machine may not be readable on another - even if both use IEEE floating
      point arithmetic (as the endian-ness of the memory representation is not
      part of the IEEE spec). See also perlport.
    <p class="Pp">Note that Perl uses doubles internally for all numeric
        calculation, and converting from double into float and thence back to
        double again will lose precision (i.e.,
        <span class="Li">&#34;unpack(&#34;f&#34;, pack(&#34;f&#34;,
        $foo)&#34;</span>) will not in general equal
        <span class="Li">$foo</span>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>If the pattern begins with a <span class="Li">&#34;U&#34;</span>, the
      resulting string will be treated as UTF-8-encoded Unicode. You can force
      UTF-8 encoding on in a string with an initial
      <span class="Li">&#34;U0&#34;</span>, and the bytes that follow will be
      interpreted as Unicode characters. If you don&#39;t want this to happen, you
      can begin your pattern with <span class="Li">&#34;C0&#34;</span> (or
      anything else) to force Perl not to UTF-8 encode your string, and then
      follow this with a <span class="Li">&#34;U*&#34;</span> somewhere in
      your pattern.</li>
  <li>You must yourself do any alignment or padding by inserting for example
      enough <span class="Li">&#39;x&#39;</span>es while packing. There is no way to
      <i>pack()</i> and <i>unpack()</i> could know where the bytes are going to
      or coming from. Therefore <span class="Li">&#34;pack&#34;</span> (and
      <span class="Li">&#34;unpack&#34;</span>) handle their output and input
      as flat sequences of bytes.</li>
  <li>A ()-group is a sub-TEMPLATE enclosed in parentheses. A group may take a
      repeat count, both as postfix, and for <i>unpack()</i> also via the
      <span class="Li">&#34;/&#34;</span> template character. Within each
      repetition of a group, positioning with
      <span class="Li">&#34;@&#34;</span> starts again at 0. Therefore, the
      result of
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    pack( &#39;@1A((@2A)@3A)&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39; )
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is the string &#34;\0a\0\0bc&#34;.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&#34;x&#34;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&#34;X&#34;</span> accept
      <span class="Li">&#34;!&#34;</span> modifier. In this case they act as
      alignment commands: they jump forward/back to the closest position aligned
      at a multiple of <span class="Li">&#34;count&#34;</span> bytes. For
      example, to <i>pack()</i> or <i>unpack()</i> C&#39;s
      <span class="Li">&#34;struct {char c; double d; char cc[2]}&#34;</span>
      one may need to use the template <span class="Li">&#34;C x![d] d
      C[2]&#34;</span>; this assumes that doubles must be aligned on the
      double&#39;s size.
    <p class="Pp">For alignment commands
        <span class="Li">&#34;count&#34;</span> of 0 is equivalent to
        <span class="Li">&#34;count&#34;</span> of 1; both result in
      no-ops.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A comment in a TEMPLATE starts with <span class="Li">&#34;#&#34;</span>
      and goes to the end of line. White space may be used to separate pack
      codes from each other, but a <span class="Li">&#34;!&#34;</span>
      modifier and a repeat count must follow immediately.</li>
  <li>If TEMPLATE requires more arguments to <i>pack()</i> than actually given,
      <i>pack()</i> assumes additional <span class="Li">&#34;&#34;</span>
      arguments. If TEMPLATE requires less arguments to <i>pack()</i> than
      actually given, extra arguments are ignored.</li>

  <dt>package NAMESPACE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>package</dt>
  <dd>Declares the compilation unit as being in the given namespace. The scope
      of the package declaration is from the declaration itself through the end
      of the enclosing block, file, or eval (the same as the
      <span class="Li">&#34;my&#34;</span> operator). All further unqualified
      dynamic identifiers will be in this namespace. A package statement affects
      only dynamic variables--including those you&#39;ve used
      <span class="Li">&#34;local&#34;</span> on--but <i>not</i> lexical
      variables, which are created with <span class="Li">&#34;my&#34;</span>.
      Typically it would be the first declaration in a file to be included by
      the <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&#34;use&#34;</span> operator. You can switch into a
      package in more than one place; it merely influences which symbol table is
      used by the compiler for the rest of that block. You can refer to
      variables and filehandles in other packages by prefixing the identifier
      with the package name and a double colon:
      <span class="Li">$Package::Variable</span>. If the package name is null,
      the <span class="Li">&#34;main&#34;</span> package as assumed. That is,
      <span class="Li">$::sail</span> is equivalent to
      <span class="Li">$main::sail</span> (as well as to
      <span class="Li">$main&#39;sail</span>, still seen in older code).
    <p class="Pp">If NAMESPACE is omitted, then there is no current package, and
        all identifiers must be fully qualified or lexicals. However, you are
        strongly advised not to make use of this feature. Its use can cause
        unexpected behaviour, even crashing some versions of Perl. It is
        deprecated, and will be removed from a future release.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &#34;Packages&#34; in perlmod for more information about
        packages, modules, and classes. See perlsub for other scoping
      issues.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>pipe READHANDLE,WRITEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd>Opens a pair of connected pipes like the corresponding system call. Note
      that if you set up a loop of piped processes, deadlock can occur unless
      you are very careful. In addition, note that Perl&#39;s pipes use IO
      buffering, so you may need to set <span class="Li">$⎪</span> to
      flush your WRITEHANDLE after each command, depending on the application.
    <p class="Pp">See IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3, and &#34;Bidirectional
        Communication&#34; in perlipc for examples of such things.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on files, the

        the value of $^F. See &#34;$^F&#34; in perlvar.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>pop ARRAY</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>pop</dt>
  <dd>Pops and returns the last value of the array, shortening the array by one

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $ARRAY[$#ARRAY--]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If there are no elements in the array, returns the undefined
        value (although this may happen at other times as well). If ARRAY is
        omitted, pops the <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> array in the main
        program, and the <span class="Li">@_</span> array in subroutines, just
        like <span class="Li">&#34;shift&#34;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>pos SCALAR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>pos</dt>
  <dd>Returns the offset of where the last

      in question (<span class="Li">$_</span> is used when the variable is not
      specified). May be modified to change that offset. Such modification will
      also influence the <span class="Li">&#34;\G&#34;</span> zero-width
      assertion in regular expressions. See perlre and perlop.</dd>
  <dt>print FILEHANDLE LIST</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>print LIST</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>print</dt>
  <dd>Prints a string or a list of strings. Returns true if successful.
      FILEHANDLE may be a scalar variable name, in which case the variable
      contains the name of or a reference to the filehandle, thus introducing
      one level of indirection. (NOTE: If FILEHANDLE is a variable and the next
      token is a term, it may be misinterpreted as an operator unless you
      interpose a <span class="Li">&#34;+&#34;</span> or put parentheses
      around the arguments.) If FILEHANDLE is omitted, prints by default to
      standard output (or to the last selected output channel--see
      &#34;select&#34;). If LIST is also omitted, prints
      <span class="Li">$_</span> to the currently selected output channel. To
      set the default output channel to something other than STDOUT use the
      select operation. The current value of <span class="Li">$,</span> (if any)
      is printed between each LIST item. The current value of
      <span class="Li">&#34;$\&#34;</span> (if any) is printed after the
      entire LIST has been printed. Because print takes a LIST, anything in the
      LIST is evaluated in list context, and any subroutine that you call will
      have one or more of its expressions evaluated in list context. Also be
      careful not to follow the print keyword with a left parenthesis unless you
      want the corresponding right parenthesis to terminate the arguments to the
      print--interpose a <span class="Li">&#34;+&#34;</span> or put
      parentheses around all the arguments.
    <p class="Pp">Note that if you&#39;re storing FILEHANDLES in an array or other
        expression, you will have to use a block returning its value
      instead:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print { $files[$i] } &#34;stuff\n&#34;;
    print { $OK ? STDOUT : STDERR } &#34;stuff\n&#34;;

  <dd></dd>
  <dt>printf FORMAT, LIST</dt>
  <dd>Equivalent to <span class="Li">&#34;print FILEHANDLE sprintf(FORMAT,
      LIST)&#34;</span>, except that <span class="Li">&#34;$\&#34;</span>
      (the output record separator) is not appended. The first argument of the
      list will be interpreted as the <span class="Li">&#34;printf&#34;</span>
      format. See <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span> for an explanation
      of the format argument. If <span class="Li">&#34;use locale&#34;</span>
      is in effect, the character used for the decimal point in formatted real
      numbers is affected by the LC_NUMERIC locale. See perllocale.
    <p class="Pp">Don&#39;t fall into the trap of using a
        <span class="Li">&#34;printf&#34;</span> when a simple
        <span class="Li">&#34;print&#34;</span> would do. The

  </dd>
  <dt>prototype FUNCTION</dt>
  <dd>Returns the prototype of a function as a string (or
      <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> if the function has no
      prototype). FUNCTION is a reference to, or the name of, the function whose
      prototype you want to retrieve.
    <p class="Pp">If FUNCTION is a string starting with
        <span class="Li">&#34;CORE::&#34;</span>, the rest is taken as a name
        for Perl builtin. If the builtin is not <i>overridable</i> (such as
        <span class="Li">&#34;qw//&#34;</span>) or its arguments cannot be
        expressed by a prototype (such as
        <span class="Li">&#34;system&#34;</span>) returns
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> because the builtin does not

  </dd>
  <dt>push ARRAY,LIST</dt>
  <dd>Treats ARRAY as a stack, and pushes the values of LIST onto the end of

    <pre>    for $value (LIST) {

      <span class="Li">&#34;/[A-Za-z_0-9]/&#34;</span> will be preceded by a
      backslash in the returned string, regardless of any locale settings.) This
      is the internal function implementing the

  <dt>rand EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>rand</dt>
  <dd>Returns a random fractional number greater than or equal to

      positive.) If EXPR is omitted, the value <span class="Li">1</span> is
      used. Currently EXPR with the value <span class="Li">0</span> is also
      special-cased as <span class="Li">1</span> - this has not been documented
      before perl 5.8.0 and is subject to change in future versions of perl.
      Automatically calls <span class="Li">&#34;srand&#34;</span> unless

  </dd>
  <dt>read FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH,OFFSET</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>read FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH</dt>
  <dd>Attempts to read LENGTH <i>characters</i> of data into variable SCALAR

    <p class="Pp">An OFFSET may be specified to place the read data at some
        place in the string other than the beginning. A negative OFFSET
        specifies placement at that many characters counting backwards from the
        end of the string. A positive OFFSET greater than the length of SCALAR
        results in the string being padded to the required size with
        <span class="Li">&#34;\0&#34;</span> bytes before the result of the
        read is appended.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The call is actually implemented in terms of either Perl&#39;s or
        system&#39;s <i>fread()</i> call. To get a true <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/read.2.zh_CN.html">read(2)</a> system call,
        see <span class="Li">&#34;sysread&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note the <i>characters</i>: depending on the status of the
        filehandle, either (8-bit) bytes or characters are read. By default all
        filehandles operate on bytes, but for example if the filehandle has been
        opened with the <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span> I/O layer (see
        &#34;open&#34;, and the <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span>
        pragma, open), the I/O will operate on UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters,
        not bytes. Similarly for the
        <span class="Li">&#34;:encoding&#34;</span> pragma: in that case
        pretty much any characters can be read.</p>

    <p class="Pp">If you&#39;re planning to filetest the return values out of a

  <dt>readline EXPR</dt>
  <dd>Reads from the filehandle whose typeglob is contained in EXPR. In scalar
      context, each call reads and returns the next line, until end-of-file is
      reached, whereupon the subsequent call returns undef. In list context,
      reads until end-of-file is reached and returns a list of lines. Note that
      the notion of &#34;line&#34; used here is however you may have defined
      it with <span class="Li">$/</span> or

  <dt>readpipe EXPR</dt>
  <dd>EXPR is executed as a system command. The collected standard output of the

  <dt>recv SOCKET,SCALAR,LENGTH,FLAGS</dt>
  <dd>Receives a message on a socket. Attempts to receive LENGTH characters of
      data into variable SCALAR from the specified SOCKET filehandle. SCALAR
      will be grown or shrunk to the length actually read. Takes the same flags
      as the system call of the same name. Returns the address of the sender if
      SOCKET&#39;s protocol supports this; returns an empty string otherwise. If
      there&#39;s an error, returns the undefined value. This call is actually
      implemented in terms of <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/recvfrom.2.en.html">recvfrom(2)</a> system call. See &#34;UDP:
      Message Passing&#34; in perlipc for examples.
    <p class="Pp">Note the <i>characters</i>: depending on the status of the

  <dt>rename OLDNAME,NEWNAME</dt>

      Returns true for success, false otherwise.
    <p class="Pp">Behavior of this function varies wildly depending on your
        system implementation. For example, it will usually not work across file
        system boundaries, even though the system <i>mv</i> command sometimes
        compensates for this. Other restrictions include whether it works on
        directories, open files, or pre-existing files. Check perlport and
        either the <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/rename.2.en.html">rename(2)</a> manpage or equivalent system documentation

  </dd>
  <dt>require VERSION</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>require EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>require</dt>
  <dd>Demands a version of Perl specified by VERSION, or demands some semantics
      specified by EXPR or by <span class="Li">$_</span> if EXPR is not
      supplied.
    <p class="Pp">VERSION may be either a numeric argument such as 5.006, which
        will be compared to <span class="Li">$]</span>, or a literal of the form
        v5.6.1, which will be compared to <span class="Li">$^V</span> (aka
        <span class="Li">$PERL_VERSION</span>). A fatal error is produced at run
        time if VERSION is greater than the version of the current Perl
        interpreter. Compare with &#34;use&#34;, which can do a similar check
        at compile time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specifying VERSION as a literal of the form v5.6.1 should
        generally be avoided, because it leads to misleading error messages
        under earlier versions of Perl which do not support this syntax. The
        equivalent numeric version should be used instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    require v5.6.1;     # run time version check
    require 5.6.1;      # ditto
    require 5.006_001;  # ditto; preferred for backwards compatibility
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise, demands that a library file be included if it
        hasn&#39;t already been included. The file is included via the do-FILE
        mechanism, which is essentially just a variety of
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span>. Has semantics similar to the
        following subroutine:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub require {
        my($filename) = @_;
        return 1 if $INC{$filename};
        my($realfilename,$result);
        ITER: {
            foreach $prefix (@INC) {
                $realfilename = &#34;$prefix/$filename&#34;;
                if (-f $realfilename) {
                    $INC{$filename} = $realfilename;
                    $result = do $realfilename;
                    last ITER;
                }
            }
            die &#34;Can&#39;t find $filename in \@INC&#34;;
        }
        delete $INC{$filename} if $@ ⎪⎪ !$result;
        die $@ if $@;
        die &#34;$filename did not return true value&#34; unless $result;
        return $result;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the file will not be included twice under the same
        specified name. The file must return true as the last statement to
        indicate successful execution of any initialization code, so it&#39;s
        customary to end such a file with <span class="Li">&#34;1;&#34;</span>
        unless you&#39;re sure it&#39;ll return true otherwise. But it&#39;s better just to
        put the <span class="Li">&#34;1;&#34;</span>, in case you add more
        statements.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is a bareword, the require assumes a
        &#34;<i>.pm</i>&#34; extension and replaces &#34;<i>::</i>&#34; with
        &#34;<i>/</i>&#34; in the filename for you, to make it easy to load
        standard modules. This form of loading of modules does not risk altering
        your namespace.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In other words, if you try this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        require Foo::Bar;    # a splendid bareword
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The require function will actually look for the
        &#34;<i>Foo/Bar.pm</i>&#34; file in the directories specified in the
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> array.</p>
    <p class="Pp">But if you try this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        $class = &#39;Foo::Bar&#39;;
        require $class;      # $class is not a bareword
    #or
        require &#34;Foo::Bar&#34;;  # not a bareword because of the &#34;&#34;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The require function will look for the
        &#34;<i>Foo::Bar</i>&#34; file in the <span class="Li">@INC</span>
        array and will complain about not finding &#34;<i>Foo::Bar</i>&#34;
        there. In this case you can do:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        eval &#34;require $class&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Now that you understand how
        <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span> looks for files in the case
        of a bareword argument, there is a little extra functionality going on
        behind the scenes. Before <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span>
        looks for a &#34;<i>.pm</i>&#34; extension, it will first look for a
        filename with a &#34;<i>.pmc</i>&#34; extension. A file with this
        extension is assumed to be Perl bytecode generated by B::Bytecode. If
        this file is found, and it&#39;s modification time is newer than a
        coinciding &#34;<i>.pm</i>&#34; non-compiled file, it will be loaded
        in place of that non-compiled file ending in a &#34;<i>.pm</i>&#34;
        extension.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also insert hooks into the import facility, by putting
        directly Perl code into the <span class="Li">@INC</span> array. There
        are three forms of hooks: subroutine references, array references and
        blessed objects.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Subroutine references are the simplest case. When the
        inclusion system walks through <span class="Li">@INC</span> and
        encounters a subroutine, this subroutine gets called with two
        parameters, the first being a reference to itself, and the second the
        name of the file to be included (e.g. &#34;<i>Foo/Bar.pm</i>&#34;).
        The subroutine should return <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span>
        or a filehandle, from which the file to include will be read. If
        <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> is returned,
        <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span> will look at the remaining
        elements of <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the hook is an array reference, its first element must be a
        subroutine reference. This subroutine is called as above, but the first
        parameter is the array reference. This enables to pass indirectly some
        arguments to the subroutine.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In other words, you can write:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    push @INC, \&amp;my_sub;
    sub my_sub {
        my ($coderef, $filename) = @_;  # $coderef is \&amp;my_sub
        ...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    push @INC, [ \&amp;my_sub, $x, $y, ... ];
    sub my_sub {
        my ($arrayref, $filename) = @_;
        # Retrieve $x, $y, ...
        my @parameters = @$arrayref[1..$#$arrayref];
        ...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the hook is an object, it must provide an INC method, that
        will be called as above, the first parameter being the object itself.
        (Note that you must fully qualify the sub&#39;s name, as it is always forced
        into package <span class="Li">&#34;main&#34;</span>.) Here is a
        typical code layout:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # In Foo.pm
    package Foo;
    sub new { ... }
    sub Foo::INC {
        my ($self, $filename) = @_;
        ...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # In the main program
    push @INC, new Foo(...);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that these hooks are also permitted to set the
        <span class="Li">%INC</span> entry corresponding to the files they have
        loaded. See &#34;%INC&#34; in perlvar.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For a yet-more-powerful import facility, see &#34;use&#34;
        and perlmod.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>reset EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>reset</dt>
  <dd>Generally used in a <span class="Li">&#34;continue&#34;</span> block at
      the end of a loop to clear variables and reset
      <span class="Li">&#34;??&#34;</span> searches so that they work again.
      The expression is interpreted as a list of single characters (hyphens
      allowed for ranges). All variables and arrays beginning with one of those
      letters are reset to their pristine state. If the expression is omitted,
      one-match searches (<span class="Li">&#34;?pattern?&#34;</span>) are
      reset to match again. Resets only variables or searches in the current
      package. Always returns 1. Examples:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    reset &#39;X&#39;;          # reset all X variables
    reset &#39;a-z&#39;;        # reset lower case variables
    reset;              # just reset ?one-time? searches
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Resetting <span class="Li">&#34;A-Z&#34;</span> is not
        recommended because you&#39;ll wipe out your <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>
        and <span class="Li">@INC</span> arrays and your
        <span class="Li">%ENV</span> hash. Resets only package
        variables--lexical variables are unaffected, but they clean themselves
        up on scope exit anyway, so you&#39;ll probably want to use them instead.

  </dd>
  <dt>reverse LIST</dt>
  <dd>In list context, returns a list value consisting of the elements of LIST
      in the opposite order. In scalar context, concatenates the elements of
      LIST and returns a string value with all characters in the opposite order.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print reverse &lt;&gt;;           # line tac, last line first
    </pre>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This operator is also handy for inverting a hash, although
        there are some caveats. If a value is duplicated in the original hash,
        only one of those can be represented as a key in the inverted hash.
        Also, this has to unwind one hash and build a whole new one, which may
        take some time on a large hash, such as from a DBM file.</p>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt>rindex STR,SUBSTR</dt>

  <dd>Deletes the directory specified by FILENAME if that directory is empty. If

      <span class="Li">$!</span> (errno). If FILENAME is omitted, uses
      <span class="Li">$_</span>.</dd>
  <dt>s///</dt>
  <dd>The substitution operator. See perlop.</dd>
  <dt>scalar EXPR</dt>
  <dd>Forces EXPR to be interpreted in scalar context and returns the value of
      EXPR.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @counts = ( scalar @a, scalar @b, scalar @c );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">There is no equivalent operator to force an expression to be
        interpolated in list context because in practice, this is never needed.
        If you really wanted to do so, however, you could use the construction
        <span class="Li">&#34;@{[ (some expression) ]}&#34;</span>, but
        usually a simple <span class="Li">&#34;(some expression)&#34;</span>
        suffices.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&#34;scalar&#34;</span> is unary
        operator, if you accidentally use for EXPR a parenthesized list, this
        behaves as a scalar comma expression, evaluating all but the last
        element in void context and returning the final element evaluated in
        scalar context. This is seldom what you want.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The following single statement:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        print uc(scalar(&amp;foo,$bar)),$baz;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is the moral equivalent of these two:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        &amp;foo;
        print(uc($bar),$baz);

    <p class="Pp">See perlop for more details on unary operators and the comma
        operator.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>seek FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE</dt>
  <dd>Sets FILEHANDLE&#39;s position, just like the
      <span class="Li">&#34;fseek&#34;</span> call of
      <span class="Li">&#34;stdio&#34;</span>. FILEHANDLE may be an expression
      whose value gives the name of the filehandle. The values for WHENCE are
      <span class="Li">0</span> to set the new position <i>in bytes</i> to
      POSITION, <span class="Li">1</span> to set it to the current position plus
      POSITION, and <span class="Li">2</span> to set it to EOF plus POSITION
      (typically negative). For WHENCE you may use the constants
      <span class="Li">&#34;SEEK_SET&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;SEEK_CUR&#34;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&#34;SEEK_END&#34;</span> (start of the file, current
      position, end of the file) from the Fcntl module. Returns
      <span class="Li">1</span> upon success, <span class="Li">0</span>
      otherwise.
    <p class="Pp">Note the <i>in bytes</i>: even if the filehandle has been set
        to operate on characters (for example by using the
        <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span> open layer), <i>tell()</i>
        will return byte offsets, not character offsets (because implementing
        that would render <i>seek()</i> and <i>tell()</i> rather slow).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to position file for
        <span class="Li">&#34;sysread&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;syswrite&#34;</span>, don&#39;t use
        <span class="Li">&#34;seek&#34;</span>--buffering makes its effect on
        the file&#39;s system position unpredictable and non-portable. Use
        <span class="Li">&#34;sysseek&#34;</span> instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Due to the rules and rigors of ANSI C, on some systems you
        have to do a seek whenever you switch between reading and writing.
        Amongst other things, this may have the effect of calling stdio&#39;s
        <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/clearerr.3.zh_CN.html">clearerr(3)</a>. A WHENCE of <span class="Li">1</span>
        (<span class="Li">&#34;SEEK_CUR&#34;</span>) is useful for not moving
        the file position:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    seek(TEST,0,1);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is also useful for applications emulating
        <span class="Li">&#34;tail -f&#34;</span>. Once you hit EOF on your
        read, and then sleep for a while, you might have to stick in a
        <i>seek()</i> to reset things. The
        <span class="Li">&#34;seek&#34;</span> doesn&#39;t change the current
        position, but it <i>does</i> clear the end-of-file condition on the
        handle, so that the next
        <span class="Li">&#34;&lt;FILE&gt;&#34;</span> makes Perl try again to
        read something. We hope.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If that doesn&#39;t work (some IO implementations are particularly
        cantankerous), then you may need something more like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    for (;;) {
        for ($curpos = tell(FILE); $_ = &lt;FILE&gt;;
             $curpos = tell(FILE)) {
            # search for some stuff and put it into files
        }
        sleep($for_a_while);
        seek(FILE, $curpos, 0);
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>seekdir DIRHANDLE,POS</dt>
  <dd>Sets the current position for the
      <span class="Li">&#34;readdir&#34;</span> routine on DIRHANDLE. POS must
      be a value returned by <span class="Li">&#34;telldir&#34;</span>. Has
      the same caveats about possible directory compaction as the corresponding
      system library routine.</dd>
  <dt>select FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>select</dt>
  <dd>Returns the currently selected filehandle. Sets the current default
      filehandle for output, if FILEHANDLE is supplied. This has two effects:
      first, a <span class="Li">&#34;write&#34;</span> or a
      <span class="Li">&#34;print&#34;</span> without a filehandle will
      default to this FILEHANDLE. Second, references to variables related to
      output will refer to this output channel. For example, if you have to set
      the top of form format for more than one output channel, you might do the
      following:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    select(REPORT1);
    $^ = &#39;report1_top&#39;;
    select(REPORT2);
    $^ = &#39;report2_top&#39;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the name of
        the actual filehandle. Thus:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $oldfh = select(STDERR); $⎪ = 1; select($oldfh);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Some programmers may prefer to think of filehandles as objects
        with methods, preferring to write the last example as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use IO::Handle;
    STDERR-&gt;autoflush(1);
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>select RBITS,WBITS,EBITS,TIMEOUT</dt>
  <dd>This calls the <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/select.2.en.html">select(2)</a> system call with the bit masks specified,
      which can be constructed using <span class="Li">&#34;fileno&#34;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&#34;vec&#34;</span>, along these lines:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $rin = $win = $ein = &#39;&#39;;
    vec($rin,fileno(STDIN),1) = 1;
    vec($win,fileno(STDOUT),1) = 1;
    $ein = $rin ⎪ $win;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to select on many filehandles you might wish to
        write a subroutine:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub fhbits {
        my(@fhlist) = split(&#39; &#39;,$_[0]);
        my($bits);
        for (@fhlist) {
            vec($bits,fileno($_),1) = 1;
        }
        $bits;
    }
    $rin = fhbits(&#39;STDIN TTY SOCK&#39;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The usual idiom is:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($nfound,$timeleft) =
      select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, $timeout);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or to block until something becomes ready just do this</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $nfound = select($rout=$rin, $wout=$win, $eout=$ein, undef);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Most systems do not bother to return anything useful in
        <span class="Li">$timeleft</span>, so calling <i>select()</i> in scalar
        context just returns <span class="Li">$nfound</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Any of the bit masks can also be undef. The timeout, if
        specified, is in seconds, which may be fractional. Note: not all
        implementations are capable of returning the
        <span class="Li">$timeleft</span>. If not, they always return
        <span class="Li">$timeleft</span> equal to the supplied
        <span class="Li">$timeout</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can effect a sleep of 250 milliseconds this way:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    select(undef, undef, undef, 0.25);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that whether <span class="Li">&#34;select&#34;</span>

  <dt>sort LIST</dt>
  <dd>In list context, this sorts the LIST and returns the sorted list value. In
      scalar context, the behaviour of
      <span class="Li">&#34;sort()&#34;</span> is undefined.
    <p class="Pp">If SUBNAME or BLOCK is omitted,
        <span class="Li">&#34;sort&#34;</span>s in standard string comparison
        order. If SUBNAME is specified, it gives the name of a subroutine that
        returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than
        <span class="Li">0</span>, depending on how the elements of the list are
        to be ordered. (The <span class="Li">&#34;&lt;=&gt;&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;cmp&#34;</span> operators are extremely useful
        in such routines.) SUBNAME may be a scalar variable name
        (unsubscripted), in which case the value provides the name of (or a
        reference to) the actual subroutine to use. In place of a SUBNAME, you
        can provide a BLOCK as an anonymous, in-line sort subroutine.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the subroutine&#39;s prototype is
        <span class="Li">&#34;($$)&#34;</span>, the elements to be compared
        are passed by reference in <span class="Li">@_</span>, as for a normal
        subroutine. This is slower than unprototyped subroutines, where the
        elements to be compared are passed into the subroutine as the package
        global variables <span class="Li">$a</span> and
        <span class="Li">$b</span> (see example below). Note that in the latter
        case, it is usually counter-productive to declare
        <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> as
      lexicals.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In either case, the subroutine may not be recursive. The
        values to be compared are always passed by reference, so don&#39;t modify
        them.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You also cannot exit out of the sort block or subroutine using
        any of the loop control operators described in perlsyn or with
        <span class="Li">&#34;goto&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&#34;use locale&#34;</span> is in
        effect, <span class="Li">&#34;sort LIST&#34;</span> sorts LIST
        according to the current collation locale. See perllocale.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl 5.6 and earlier used a quicksort algorithm to implement
        sort. That algorithm was not stable, and <i>could</i> go quadratic. (A
        <i>stable</i> sort preserves the input order of elements that compare
        equal. Although quicksort&#39;s run time is O(NlogN) when averaged over all
        arrays of length N, the time can be O(N**2), <i>quadratic</i> behavior,
        for some inputs.) In 5.7, the quicksort implementation was replaced with
        a stable mergesort algorithm whose worst case behavior is O(NlogN). But
        benchmarks indicated that for some inputs, on some platforms, the
        original quicksort was faster. 5.8 has a sort pragma for limited control
        of the sort. Its rather blunt control of the underlying algorithm may
        not persist into future perls, but the ability to characterize the input
        or output in implementation independent ways quite probably will. See
        sort.</p>

  <dt>split</dt>
  <dd>Splits a string into a list of strings and returns that list. By default,
      empty leading fields are preserved, and empty trailing ones are deleted.
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, returns the number of fields found and
        splits into the <span class="Li">@_</span> array. Use of split in scalar
        context is deprecated, however, because it clobbers your subroutine
        arguments.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is omitted, splits the <span class="Li">$_</span>
        string. If PATTERN is also omitted, splits on whitespace (after skipping
        any leading whitespace). Anything matching PATTERN is taken to be a
        delimiter separating the fields. (Note that the delimiter may be longer
        than one character.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LIMIT is specified and positive, it represents the maximum
        number of fields the EXPR will be split into, though the actual number
        of fields returned depends on the number of times PATTERN matches within
        EXPR. If LIMIT is unspecified or zero, trailing null fields are stripped
        (which potential users of <span class="Li">&#34;pop&#34;</span> would
        do well to remember). If LIMIT is negative, it is treated as if an
        arbitrarily large LIMIT had been specified. Note that splitting an EXPR
        that evaluates to the empty string always returns the empty list,
        regardless of the LIMIT specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A pattern matching the null string (not to be confused with a
        null pattern <span class="Li">&#34;//&#34;</span>, which is just one
        member of the set of patterns matching a null string) will split the
        value of EXPR into separate characters at each point it matches that
        way. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print join(&#39;:&#39;, split(/ */, &#39;hi there&#39;));
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">produces the output &#39;h:i:t:h:e:r:e&#39;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using the empty pattern <span class="Li">&#34;//&#34;</span>
        specifically matches the null string, and is not be confused with the
        use of <span class="Li">&#34;//&#34;</span> to mean &#34;the last
        successful pattern match&#34;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Empty leading (or trailing) fields are produced when there are
        positive width matches at the beginning (or end) of the string; a
        zero-width match at the beginning (or end) of the string does not
        produce an empty field. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   print join(&#39;:&#39;, split(/(?=\w)/, &#39;hi there!&#39;));
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">produces the output &#39;h:i :t:h:e:r:e!&#39;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The LIMIT parameter can be used to split a line partially</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($login, $passwd, $remainder) = split(/:/, $_, 3);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When assigning to a list, if LIMIT is omitted, or zero, Perl
        supplies a LIMIT one larger than the number of variables in the list, to
        avoid unnecessary work. For the list above LIMIT would have been 4 by
        default. In time critical applications it behooves you not to split into
        more fields than you really need.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the PATTERN contains parentheses, additional list elements
        are created from each matching substring in the delimiter.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    split(/([,-])/, &#34;1-10,20&#34;, 3);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">produces the list value</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    (1, &#39;-&#39;, 10, &#39;,&#39;, 20)

    <p class="Pp">If you had the entire header of a normal Unix email message in
        <span class="Li">$header</span>, you could split it up into fields and
        their values this way:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $header =~ s/\n\s+/ /g;  # fix continuation lines
    %hdrs   =  (UNIX_FROM =&gt; split /^(\S*?):\s*/m, $header);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The pattern <span class="Li">&#34;/PATTERN/&#34;</span> may
        be replaced with an expression to specify patterns that vary at runtime.
        (To do runtime compilation only once, use
        <span class="Li">&#34;/$variable/o&#34;</span>.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a special case, specifying a PATTERN of space
        (<span class="Li">&#39; &#39;</span>) will split on white space just as
        <span class="Li">&#34;split&#34;</span> with no arguments does. Thus,
        <span class="Li">&#34;split(&#39; &#39;)&#34;</span> can be used to
        emulate <b>awk</b>&#39;s default behavior, whereas
        <span class="Li">&#34;split(/ /)&#34;</span> will give you as
        many null initial fields as there are leading spaces. A
        <span class="Li">&#34;split&#34;</span> on
        <span class="Li">&#34;/\s+/&#34;</span> is like a
        <span class="Li">&#34;split(&#39; &#39;)&#34;</span> except that any
        leading whitespace produces a null first field. A
        <span class="Li">&#34;split&#34;</span> with no arguments really does
        a <span class="Li">&#34;split(&#39; &#39;, $_)&#34;</span>
        internally.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A PATTERN of <span class="Li">&#34;/^/&#34;</span> is
        treated as if it were <span class="Li">&#34;/^/m&#34;</span>, since it
        isn&#39;t much use otherwise.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(PASSWD, &#39;/etc/passwd&#39;);
    while (&lt;PASSWD&gt;) {

         $gcos, $home, $shell) = split(/:/);
        #...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As with regular pattern matching, any capturing parentheses
        that are not matched in a <span class="Li">&#34;split()&#34;</span>
        will be set to <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> when
      returned:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @fields = split /(A)⎪B/, &#34;1A2B3&#34;;
    # @fields is (1, &#39;A&#39;, 2, undef, 3)
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>sprintf FORMAT, LIST</dt>
  <dd>Returns a string formatted by the usual
      <span class="Li">&#34;printf&#34;</span> conventions of the C library
      function <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span>. See below for more
      details and see <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/sprintf.3.en.html">sprintf(3)</a> or <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/printf.3.en.html">printf(3)</a> on your system for
      an explanation of the general principles.
    <p class="Pp">For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        # Format number with up to 8 leading zeroes
        $result = sprintf(&#34;%08d&#34;, $number);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        # Round number to 3 digits after decimal point
        $rounded = sprintf(&#34;%.3f&#34;, $number);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Perl does its own <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span>
        formatting--it emulates the C function
        <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span>, but it doesn&#39;t use it
        (except for floating-point numbers, and even then only the standard
        modifiers are allowed). As a result, any non-standard extensions in your
        local <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span> are not available from
        Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unlike <span class="Li">&#34;printf&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span> does not do what you
        probably mean when you pass it an array as your first argument. The
        array is given scalar context, and instead of using the 0th element of
        the array as the format, Perl will use the count of elements in the
        array as the format, which is almost never useful.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl&#39;s <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span> permits the
        following universally-known conversions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   %%   a percent sign
   %c   a character with the given number
   %s   a string
   %d   a signed integer, in decimal
   %u   an unsigned integer, in decimal
   %o   an unsigned integer, in octal
   %x   an unsigned integer, in hexadecimal
   %e   a floating-point number, in scientific notation
   %f   a floating-point number, in fixed decimal notation
   %g   a floating-point number, in %e or %f notation
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In addition, Perl permits the following widely-supported
        conversions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   %X   like %x, but using upper-case letters
   %E   like %e, but using an upper-case &#34;E&#34;
   %G   like %g, but with an upper-case &#34;E&#34; (if applicable)
   %b   an unsigned integer, in binary
   %p   a pointer (outputs the Perl value&#39;s address in hexadecimal)
   %n   special: *stores* the number of characters output so far
        into the next variable in the parameter list
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Finally, for backward (and we do mean &#34;backward&#34;)
        compatibility, Perl permits these unnecessary but widely-supported
        conversions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   %i   a synonym for %d
   %D   a synonym for %ld
   %U   a synonym for %lu
   %O   a synonym for %lo
   %F   a synonym for %f
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the number of exponent digits in the scientific
        notation produced by <span class="Li">%e</span>,
        <span class="Li">%E</span>, <span class="Li">%g</span> and
        <span class="Li">%G</span> for numbers with the modulus of the exponent
        less than 100 is system-dependent: it may be three or less (zero-padded
        as necessary). In other words, 1.23 times ten to the 99th may be either
        &#34;1.23e99&#34; or &#34;1.23e099&#34;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Between the <span class="Li">&#34;%&#34;</span> and the
        format letter, you may specify a number of additional attributes
        controlling the interpretation of the format. In order, these are:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>format parameter index</dt>
  <dd>An explicit format parameter index, such as
      <span class="Li">&#34;2$&#34;</span>. By default sprintf will format the
      next unused argument in the list, but this allows you to take the
      arguments out of order. Eg:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;%2$d %1$d&#39;, 12, 34;      # prints &#34;34 12&#34;
  printf &#39;%3$d %d %1$d&#39;, 1, 2, 3;  # prints &#34;3 1 1&#34;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>flags</dt>
  <dd>one or more of:
     space prefix positive number with a space
     + prefix positive number with a plus sign
     - left-justify within the field
     0 use zeros, not spaces, to right-justify
     # prefix non-zero octal with &#34;0&#34;, non-zero hex with
      &#34;0x&#34;,
     non-zero binary with &#34;0b&#34;
    <p class="Pp">For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;&lt;% d&gt;&#39;, 12;   # prints &#34;&lt; 12&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%+d&gt;&#39;, 12;   # prints &#34;&lt;+12&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%6s&gt;&#39;, 12;   # prints &#34;&lt;    12&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%-6s&gt;&#39;, 12;  # prints &#34;&lt;12    &gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%06s&gt;&#39;, 12;  # prints &#34;&lt;000012&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%#x&gt;&#39;, 12;   # prints &#34;&lt;0xc&gt;&#34;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>vector flag</dt>
  <dd>The vector flag <span class="Li">&#34;v&#34;</span>, optionally
      specifying the join string to use. This flag tells perl to interpret the
      supplied string as a vector of integers, one for each character in the
      string, separated by a given string (a dot
      <span class="Li">&#34;.&#34;</span> by default). This can be useful for
      displaying ordinal values of characters in arbitrary strings:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#34;version is v%vd\n&#34;, $^V;     # Perl&#39;s version
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Put an asterisk <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span> before
        the <span class="Li">&#34;v&#34;</span> to override the string to use
        to separate the numbers:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#34;address is %*vX\n&#34;, &#34;:&#34;, $addr;   # IPv6 address
  printf &#34;bits are %0*v8b\n&#34;, &#34; &#34;, $bits;   # random bitstring
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can also explicitly specify the argument number to use for
        the join string using eg <span class="Li">&#34;*2$v&#34;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;%*4$vX %*4$vX %*4$vX&#39;, @addr[1..3], &#34;:&#34;;   # 3 IPv6 addresses
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>(minimum) width</dt>
  <dd>Arguments are usually formatted to be only as wide as required to display
      the given value. You can override the width by putting a number here, or
      get the width from the next argument (with
      <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span>) or from a specified argument (with
      eg <span class="Li">&#34;*2$&#34;</span>):
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;&lt;%s&gt;&#39;, &#34;a&#34;;       # prints &#34;&lt;a&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%6s&gt;&#39;, &#34;a&#34;;      # prints &#34;&lt;     a&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%*s&gt;&#39;, 6, &#34;a&#34;;   # prints &#34;&lt;     a&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%*2$s&gt;&#39;, &#34;a&#34;, 6; # prints &#34;&lt;     a&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%2s&gt;&#39;, &#34;long&#34;;   # prints &#34;&lt;long&gt;&#34; (does not truncate)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If a field width obtained through
        <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span> is negative, it has the same
        effect as the <span class="Li">&#34;-&#34;</span> flag:
        left-justification.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>precision, or maximum width</dt>
  <dd>You can specify a precision (for numeric conversions) or a maximum width
      (for string conversions) by specifying a
      <span class="Li">&#34;.&#34;</span> followed by a number. For floating
      point formats, with the exception of &#39;g&#39; and &#39;G&#39;, this specifies the
      number of decimal places to show (the default being 6), eg:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  # these examples are subject to system-specific variation
  printf &#39;&lt;%f&gt;&#39;, 1;    # prints &#34;&lt;1.000000&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.1f&gt;&#39;, 1;  # prints &#34;&lt;1.0&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.0f&gt;&#39;, 1;  # prints &#34;&lt;1&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%e&gt;&#39;, 10;   # prints &#34;&lt;1.000000e+01&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.1e&gt;&#39;, 10; # prints &#34;&lt;1.0e+01&gt;&#34;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For &#39;g&#39; and &#39;G&#39;, this specifies the maximum number of digits
        to show, including prior to the decimal point as well as after it,
      eg:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  # these examples are subject to system-specific variation
  printf &#39;&lt;%g&gt;&#39;, 1;        # prints &#34;&lt;1&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.10g&gt;&#39;, 1;     # prints &#34;&lt;1&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%g&gt;&#39;, 100;      # prints &#34;&lt;100&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.1g&gt;&#39;, 100;    # prints &#34;&lt;1e+02&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.2g&gt;&#39;, 100.01; # prints &#34;&lt;1e+02&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.5g&gt;&#39;, 100.01; # prints &#34;&lt;100.01&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.4g&gt;&#39;, 100.01; # prints &#34;&lt;100&gt;&#34;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For integer conversions, specifying a precision implies that
        the output of the number itself should be zero-padded to this width:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;&lt;%.6x&gt;&#39;, 1;      # prints &#34;&lt;000001&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%#.6x&gt;&#39;, 1;     # prints &#34;&lt;0x000001&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%-10.6x&gt;&#39;, 1;   # prints &#34;&lt;000001    &gt;&#34;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For string conversions, specifying a precision truncates the
        string to fit in the specified width:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;&lt;%.5s&gt;&#39;, &#34;truncated&#34;;   # prints &#34;&lt;trunc&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%10.5s&gt;&#39;, &#34;truncated&#34;; # prints &#34;&lt;     trunc&gt;&#34;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can also get the precision from the next argument using
        <span class="Li">&#34;.*&#34;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;&lt;%.6x&gt;&#39;, 1;       # prints &#34;&lt;000001&gt;&#34;
  printf &#39;&lt;%.*x&gt;&#39;, 6, 1;    # prints &#34;&lt;000001&gt;&#34;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You cannot currently get the precision from a specified
        number, but it is intended that this will be possible in the future
        using eg <span class="Li">&#34;.*2$&#34;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;&lt;%.*2$x&gt;&#39;, 1, 6;   # INVALID, but in future will print &#34;&lt;000001&gt;&#34;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>size</dt>
  <dd>For numeric conversions, you can specify the size to interpret the number
      as using <span class="Li">&#34;l&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;h&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;V&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;q&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;L&#34;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&#34;ll&#34;</span>. For integer conversions
      (<span class="Li">&#34;d u o x X b i D U O&#34;</span>), numbers are
      usually assumed to be whatever the default integer size is on your
      platform (usually 32 or 64 bits), but you can override this to use instead
      one of the standard C types, as supported by the compiler used to build
      Perl:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   l           interpret integer as C type &#34;long&#34; or &#34;unsigned long&#34;
   h           interpret integer as C type &#34;short&#34; or &#34;unsigned short&#34;
   q, L or ll  interpret integer as C type &#34;long long&#34;, &#34;unsigned long long&#34;.
               or &#34;quads&#34; (typically 64-bit integers)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The last will produce errors if Perl does not understand
        &#34;quads&#34; in your installation. (This requires that either the
        platform natively supports quads or Perl was specifically compiled to
        support quads.) You can find out whether your Perl supports quads via
        Config:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        use Config;
        ($Config{use64bitint} eq &#39;define&#39; ⎪⎪ $Config{longsize} &gt;= 8) &amp;&amp;
                print &#34;quads\n&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For floating point conversions (<span class="Li">&#34;e f g E
        F G&#34;</span>), numbers are usually assumed to be the default
        floating point size on your platform (double or long double), but you
        can force &#39;long double&#39; with <span class="Li">&#34;q&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;L&#34;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&#34;ll&#34;</span> if your platform supports them.
        You can find out whether your Perl supports long doubles via Config:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        use Config;
        $Config{d_longdbl} eq &#39;define&#39; &amp;&amp; print &#34;long doubles\n&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can find out whether Perl considers &#39;long double&#39; to be
        the default floating point size to use on your platform via Config:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        use Config;
        ($Config{uselongdouble} eq &#39;define&#39;) &amp;&amp;
                print &#34;long doubles by default\n&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It can also be the case that long doubles and doubles are the
        same thing:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        use Config;
        ($Config{doublesize} == $Config{longdblsize}) &amp;&amp;
                print &#34;doubles are long doubles\n&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The size specifier <span class="Li">&#34;V&#34;</span> has
        no effect for Perl code, but it is supported for compatibility with XS
        code; it means &#39;use the standard size for a Perl integer (or
        floating-point number)&#39;, which is already the default for Perl code.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>order of arguments</dt>
  <dd>Normally, sprintf takes the next unused argument as the value to format
      for each format specification. If the format specification uses
      <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span> to require additional arguments,
      these are consumed from the argument list in the order in which they
      appear in the format specification <i>before</i> the value to format.
      Where an argument is specified using an explicit index, this does not
      affect the normal order for the arguments (even when the explicitly
      specified index would have been the next argument in any case).
    <p class="Pp">So:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#39;&lt;%*.*s&gt;&#39;, $a, $b, $c;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would use <span class="Li">$a</span> for the width,
        <span class="Li">$b</span> for the precision and
        <span class="Li">$c</span> as the value to format, while:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  print &#39;&lt;%*1$.*s&gt;&#39;, $a, $b;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would use <span class="Li">$a</span> for the width and the
        precision, and <span class="Li">$b</span> as the value to format.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are some more examples - beware that when using an
        explicit index, the <span class="Li">&#34;$&#34;</span> may need to be
        escaped:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &#34;%2\$d %d\n&#34;,    12, 34;               # will print &#34;34 12\n&#34;
  printf &#34;%2\$d %d %d\n&#34;, 12, 34;               # will print &#34;34 12 34\n&#34;
  printf &#34;%3\$d %d %d\n&#34;, 12, 34, 56;           # will print &#34;56 12 34\n&#34;
  printf &#34;%2\$*3\$d %d\n&#34;, 12, 34, 3;           # will print &#34; 34 12\n&#34;

        sequence each time you run your program.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>srand()</i> is not called explicitly, it is called
        implicitly at the first use of the
        <span class="Li">&#34;rand&#34;</span> operator. However, this was not
        the case in versions of Perl before 5.004, so if your script will run
        under older Perl versions, it should call
        <span class="Li">&#34;srand&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Most programs won&#39;t even call <i>srand()</i> at all, except
        those that need a cryptographically-strong starting point rather than
        the generally acceptable default, which is based on time of day, process
        ID, and memory allocation, or the <i>/dev/urandom</i> device, if
        available.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can call srand($seed) with the same
        <span class="Li">$seed</span> to reproduce the <i>same</i> sequence from
        <i>rand()</i>, but this is usually reserved for generating predictable
        results for testing or debugging. Otherwise, don&#39;t call <i>srand()</i>
        more than once in your program.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Do <b>not</b> call <i>srand()</i> (i.e. without an argument)
        more than once in a script. The internal state of the random number
        generator should contain more entropy than can be provided by any seed,
        so calling <i>srand()</i> again actually <i>loses</i> randomness.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Most implementations of
        <span class="Li">&#34;srand&#34;</span> take an integer and will
        silently truncate decimal numbers. This means
        <span class="Li">&#34;srand(42)&#34;</span> will usually produce the
        same results as <span class="Li">&#34;srand(42.1)&#34;</span>. To be
        safe, always pass <span class="Li">&#34;srand&#34;</span> an
      integer.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In versions of Perl prior to 5.004 the default seed was just
        the current <span class="Li">&#34;time&#34;</span>. This isn&#39;t a
        particularly good seed, so many old programs supply their own seed value
        (often <span class="Li">&#34;time ^ $$&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;time ^</span> <span class="Li">($$ + ($$ &lt;&lt;
        15))&#34;</span>), but that isn&#39;t necessary any more.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that you need something much more random than the default
        seed for cryptographic purposes. Checksumming the compressed output of
        one or more rapidly changing operating system status programs is the
        usual method. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    srand (time ^ $$ ^ unpack &#34;%L*&#34;, `ps axww ⎪ gzip`);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you&#39;re particularly concerned with this, see the
        <span class="Li">&#34;Math::TrulyRandom&#34;</span> module in
      CPAN.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Frequently called programs (like CGI scripts) that simply
      use</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    time ^ $$
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">for a seed can fall prey to the mathematical property that</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    a^b == (a+1)^(b+1)

  </dd>
  <dt>stat FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>stat EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>stat</dt>
  <dd>Returns a 13-element list giving the status info for a file, either the
      file opened via FILEHANDLE, or named by EXPR. If EXPR is omitted, it stats
      <span class="Li">$_</span>. Returns a null list if the stat fails.
      Typically used as follows:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($dev,$ino,$mode,$nlink,$uid,$gid,$rdev,$size,
       $atime,$mtime,$ctime,$blksize,$blocks)
           = stat($filename);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Not all fields are supported on all filesystem types. Here are
        the meaning of the fields:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  0 dev      device number of filesystem
  1 ino      inode number
  2 mode     file mode  (type and permissions)
  3 nlink    number of (hard) links to the file
  4 uid      numeric user ID of file&#39;s owner
  5 gid      numeric group ID of file&#39;s owner
  6 rdev     the device identifier (special files only)
  7 size     total size of file, in bytes
  8 atime    last access time in seconds since the epoch
  9 mtime    last modify time in seconds since the epoch
 10 ctime    inode change time in seconds since the epoch (*)
 11 blksize  preferred block size for file system I/O
 12 blocks   actual number of blocks allocated
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(The epoch was at 00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">(*) The ctime field is non-portable, in particular you cannot
        expect it to be a &#34;creation time&#34;, see &#34;Files and
        Filesystems&#34; in perlport for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If stat is passed the special filehandle consisting of an
        underline, no stat is done, but the current contents of the stat
        structure from the last stat or filetest are returned. Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (-x $file &amp;&amp; (($d) = stat(_)) &amp;&amp; $d &lt; 0) {
        print &#34;$file is executable NFS file\n&#34;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(This works on machines only for which the device number is
        negative under NFS.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because the mode contains both the file type and its
        permissions, you should mask off the file type portion and (s)printf
        using a <span class="Li">&#34;%o&#34;</span> if you want to see the
        real permissions.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $mode = (stat($filename))[2];
    printf &#34;Permissions are %04o\n&#34;, $mode &amp; 07777;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, <span class="Li">&#34;stat&#34;</span>
        returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, and, if
        successful, sets the information associated with the special filehandle
        <span class="Li">&#34;_&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The File::stat module provides a convenient, by-name access
        mechanism:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use File::stat;
    $sb = stat($filename);
    printf &#34;File is %s, size is %s, perm %04o, mtime %s\n&#34;,
        $filename, $sb-&gt;size, $sb-&gt;mode &amp; 07777,
        scalar localtime $sb-&gt;mtime;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can import symbolic mode constants
        (<span class="Li">&#34;S_IF*&#34;</span>) and functions
        (<span class="Li">&#34;S_IS*&#34;</span>) from the Fcntl module:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Fcntl &#39;:mode&#39;;

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $mode = (stat($filename))[2];

  </dd>
  <dt>study SCALAR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>study</dt>
  <dd>Takes extra time to study SCALAR (<span class="Li">$_</span> if
      unspecified) in anticipation of doing many pattern matches on the string
      before it is next modified. This may or may not save time, depending on
      the nature and number of patterns you are searching on, and on the
      distribution of character frequencies in the string to be searched--you
      probably want to compare run times with and without it to see which runs
      faster. Those loops which scan for many short constant strings (including
      the constant parts of more complex patterns) will benefit most. You may
      have only one <span class="Li">&#34;study&#34;</span> active at a
      time--if you study a different scalar the first is &#34;unstudied&#34;.
      (The way <span class="Li">&#34;study&#34;</span> works is this: a linked
      list of every character in the string to be searched is made, so we know,
      for example, where all the <span class="Li">&#39;k&#39;</span> characters are.
      From each search string, the rarest character is selected, based on some
      static frequency tables constructed from some C programs and English text.
      Only those places that contain this &#34;rarest&#34; character are
      examined.)
    <p class="Pp">For example, here is a loop that inserts index producing
        entries before any line containing a certain pattern:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        study;
        print &#34;.IX foo\n&#34;       if /\bfoo\b/;
        print &#34;.IX bar\n&#34;       if /\bbar\b/;
        print &#34;.IX blurfl\n&#34;    if /\bblurfl\b/;
        # ...
        print;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In searching for
        <span class="Li">&#34;/\bfoo\b/&#34;</span>, only those locations in
        <span class="Li">$_</span> that contain
        <span class="Li">&#34;f&#34;</span> will be looked at, because
        <span class="Li">&#34;f&#34;</span> is rarer than
        <span class="Li">&#34;o&#34;</span>. In general, this is a big win
        except in pathological cases. The only question is whether it saves you
        more time than it took to build the linked list in the first place.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if you have to look for strings that you don&#39;t know
        till runtime, you can build an entire loop as a string and
        <span class="Li">&#34;eval&#34;</span> that to avoid recompiling all
        your patterns all the time. Together with undefining
        <span class="Li">$/</span> to input entire files as one record, this can
        be very fast, often faster than specialized programs like
        <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/fgrep.1.zh_CN.html">fgrep(1)</a>. The following scans a list of files
        (<span class="Li">@files</span>) for a list of words
        (<span class="Li">@words</span>), and prints out the names of those
        files that contain a match:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $search = &#39;while (&lt;&gt;) { study;&#39;;
    foreach $word (@words) {
        $search .= &#34;++\$seen{\$ARGV} if /\\b$word\\b/;\n&#34;;
    }
    $search .= &#34;}&#34;;
    @ARGV = @files;
    undef $/;
    eval $search;               # this screams
    $/ = &#34;\n&#34;;          # put back to normal input delimiter
    foreach $file (sort keys(%seen)) {

  <dd>This is subroutine definition, not a real function <i>per se</i>. Without

      function declaration, and does actually return a value: the CODE ref of
      the closure you just created.

  <dt>substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH,REPLACEMENT</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>substr EXPR,OFFSET,LENGTH</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>substr EXPR,OFFSET</dt>
  <dd>Extracts a substring out of EXPR and returns it. First character is at
      offset <span class="Li">0</span>, or whatever you&#39;ve set
      <span class="Li">$[</span> to (but don&#39;t do that). If OFFSET is negative
      (or more precisely, less than <span class="Li">$[</span>), starts that far
      from the end of the string. If LENGTH is omitted, returns everything to
      the end of the string. If LENGTH is negative, leaves that many characters
      off the end of the string.
    <p class="Pp">You can use the <i>substr()</i> function as an lvalue, in
        which case EXPR must itself be an lvalue. If you assign something
        shorter than LENGTH, the string will shrink, and if you assign something
        longer than LENGTH, the string will grow to accommodate it. To keep the
        string the same length you may need to pad or chop your value using
        <span class="Li">&#34;sprintf&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If OFFSET and LENGTH specify a substring that is partly
        outside the string, only the part within the string is returned. If the
        substring is beyond either end of the string, <i>substr()</i> returns
        the undefined value and produces a warning. When used as an lvalue,
        specifying a substring that is entirely outside the string is a fatal
        error. Here&#39;s an example showing the behavior for boundary cases:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $name = &#39;fred&#39;;
    substr($name, 4) = &#39;dy&#39;;            # $name is now &#39;freddy&#39;
    my $null = substr $name, 6, 2;      # returns &#39;&#39; (no warning)
    my $oops = substr $name, 7;         # returns undef, with warning
    substr($name, 7) = &#39;gap&#39;;           # fatal error
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">An alternative to using <i>substr()</i> as an lvalue is to
        specify the replacement string as the 4th argument. This allows you to
        replace parts of the EXPR and return what was there before in one
        operation, just as you can with <i>splice()</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the lvalue returned by substr is used after the EXPR is
        changed in any way, the behaviour may not be as expected and is subject
        to change. This caveat includes code such as
        <span class="Li">&#34;print(substr($foo,$a,$b)=$bar)&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;(substr($foo,$a,$b)=$bar)=$fud&#34;</span>
        (where <span class="Li">$foo</span> is changed via the substring
        assignment, and then the substr is used again), or where a
        <i>substr()</i> is aliased via a
        <span class="Li">&#34;foreach&#34;</span> loop or passed as a
        parameter or a reference to it is taken and then the alias, parameter,
        or deref&#39;d reference either is used after the original EXPR has been
        changed or is assigned to and then used a second time.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>symlink OLDFILE,NEWFILE</dt>
  <dd>Creates a new filename symbolically linked to the old filename. Returns
      <span class="Li">1</span> for success, <span class="Li">0</span>
      otherwise. On systems that don&#39;t support symbolic links, produces a fatal
      error at run time. To check for that, use eval:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $symlink_exists = eval { symlink(&#34;&#34;,&#34;&#34;); 1 };
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>syscall NUMBER, LIST</dt>
  <dd>Calls the system call specified as the first element of the list, passing
      the remaining elements as arguments to the system call. If unimplemented,
      produces a fatal error. The arguments are interpreted as follows: if a
      given argument is numeric, the argument is passed as an int. If not, the
      pointer to the string value is passed. You are responsible to make sure a
      string is pre-extended long enough to receive any result that might be
      written into a string. You can&#39;t use a string literal (or other read-only
      string) as an argument to <span class="Li">&#34;syscall&#34;</span>
      because Perl has to assume that any string pointer might be written
      through. If your integer arguments are not literals and have never been
      interpreted in a numeric context, you may need to add
      <span class="Li">0</span> to them to force them to look like numbers. This
      emulates the <span class="Li">&#34;syswrite&#34;</span> function (or
      vice versa):
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    require &#39;syscall.ph&#39;;               # may need to run h2ph
    $s = &#34;hi there\n&#34;;
    syscall(&amp;SYS_write, fileno(STDOUT), $s, length $s);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that Perl supports passing of up to only 14 arguments to
        your system call, which in practice should usually suffice.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Syscall returns whatever value returned by the system call it
        calls. If the system call fails,
        <span class="Li">&#34;syscall&#34;</span> returns
        <span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span> and sets
        <span class="Li">$!</span> (errno). Note that some system calls can
        legitimately return <span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span>. The proper
        way to handle such calls is to assign
        <span class="Li">&#34;$!=0;&#34;</span> before the call and check the
        value of <span class="Li">$!</span> if syscall returns
        <span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There&#39;s a problem with
        <span class="Li">&#34;syscall(&amp;SYS_pipe)&#34;</span>: it returns
        the file number of the read end of the pipe it creates. There is no way
        to retrieve the file number of the other end. You can avoid this problem
        by using <span class="Li">&#34;pipe&#34;</span> instead.</p>

  <dt>sysopen FILEHANDLE,FILENAME,MODE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>sysopen FILEHANDLE,FILENAME,MODE,PERMS</dt>
  <dd>Opens the file whose filename is given by FILENAME, and associates it with
      FILEHANDLE. If FILEHANDLE is an expression, its value is used as the name
      of the real filehandle wanted. This function calls the underlying
      operating system&#39;s <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> function with
      the parameters FILENAME, MODE, PERMS.
    <p class="Pp">The possible values and flag bits of the MODE parameter are
        system-dependent; they are available via the standard module
        <span class="Li">&#34;Fcntl&#34;</span>. See the documentation of your
        operating system&#39;s <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> to see which
        values and flag bits are available. You may combine several flags using
        the <span class="Li">&#34;⎪&#34;</span>-operator.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some of the most common values are
        <span class="Li">&#34;O_RDONLY&#34;</span> for opening the file in
        read-only mode, <span class="Li">&#34;O_WRONLY&#34;</span> for opening
        the file in write-only mode, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;O_RDWR&#34;</span> for opening the file in
        read-write mode, and.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For historical reasons, some values work on almost every
        system supported by perl: zero means read-only, one means write-only,
        and two means read/write. We know that these values do <i>not</i> work
        under OS/390 &amp; VM/ESA Unix and on the Macintosh; you probably don&#39;t
        want to use them in new code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the file named by FILENAME does not exist and the

        flag), then the value of PERMS specifies the permissions of the newly
        created file. If you omit the PERMS argument to
        <span class="Li">&#34;sysopen&#34;</span>, Perl uses the octal value
        <span class="Li">0666</span>. These permission values need to be in
        octal, and are modified by your process&#39;s current
        <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In many systems the <span class="Li">&#34;O_EXCL&#34;</span>
        flag is available for opening files in exclusive mode. This is
        <b>not</b> locking: exclusiveness means here that if the file already
        exists, <i>sysopen()</i> fails. The
        <span class="Li">&#34;O_EXCL&#34;</span> wins
        <span class="Li">&#34;O_TRUNC&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Sometimes you may want to truncate an already-existing file:
        <span class="Li">&#34;O_TRUNC&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You should seldom if ever use <span class="Li">0644</span> as
        argument to <span class="Li">&#34;sysopen&#34;</span>, because that
        takes away the user&#39;s option to have a more permissive umask. Better to
        omit it. See the <a href="../../buster/perl-doc/perlfunc.1.en.html">perlfunc(1)</a> entry on
        <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span> for more on this.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&#34;sysopen&#34;</span> depends
        on the <i>fdopen()</i> C library function. On many UNIX systems,
        <i>fdopen()</i> is known to fail when file descriptors exceed a certain
        value, typically 255. If you need more file descriptors than that,
        consider rebuilding Perl to use the
        <span class="Li">&#34;sfio&#34;</span> library, or perhaps using the
        <i>POSIX::open()</i> function.</p>

        files.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>sysread FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH,OFFSET</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>sysread FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH</dt>
  <dd>Attempts to read LENGTH bytes of data into variable SCALAR from the
      specified FILEHANDLE, using the system call <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/read.2.zh_CN.html">read(2)</a>. It bypasses
      buffered IO, so mixing this with other kinds of reads,
      <span class="Li">&#34;print&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;write&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;seek&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;tell&#34;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&#34;eof&#34;</span> can cause confusion because the
      perlio or stdio layers usually buffers data. Returns the number of bytes
      actually read, <span class="Li">0</span> at end of file, or undef if there
      was an error (in the latter case <span class="Li">$!</span> is also set).
      SCALAR will be grown or shrunk so that the last byte actually read is the
      last byte of the scalar after the read.
    <p class="Pp">An OFFSET may be specified to place the read data at some
        place in the string other than the beginning. A negative OFFSET
        specifies placement at that many characters counting backwards from the
        end of the string. A positive OFFSET greater than the length of SCALAR
        results in the string being padded to the required size with
        <span class="Li">&#34;\0&#34;</span> bytes before the result of the
        read is appended.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no <i>syseof()</i> function, which is ok, since
        <i>eof()</i> doesn&#39;t work very well on device files (like ttys) anyway.
        Use <i>sysread()</i> and check for a return value for 0 to decide
        whether you&#39;re done.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if the filehandle has been marked as
        <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span> Unicode characters are read
        instead of bytes (the LENGTH, OFFSET, and the return value of
        <i>sysread()</i> are in Unicode characters). The
        <span class="Li">&#34;:encoding(...)&#34;</span> layer implicitly
        introduces the <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span> layer. See
        &#34;binmode&#34;, &#34;open&#34;, and the
        <span class="Li">&#34;open&#34;</span> pragma, open.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>sysseek FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE</dt>
  <dd>Sets FILEHANDLE&#39;s system position in bytes using the system call
      <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/lseek.2.en.html">lseek(2)</a>. FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the
      name of the filehandle. The values for WHENCE are
      <span class="Li">0</span> to set the new position to POSITION,
      <span class="Li">1</span> to set the it to the current position plus
      POSITION, and <span class="Li">2</span> to set it to EOF plus POSITION
      (typically negative).
    <p class="Pp">Note the <i>in bytes</i>: even if the filehandle has been set
        to operate on characters (for example by using the
        <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span> I/O layer), <i>tell()</i> will
        return byte offsets, not character offsets (because implementing that
        would render <i>sysseek()</i> very slow).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>sysseek()</i> bypasses normal buffered IO, so mixing this
        with reads (other than <span class="Li">&#34;sysread&#34;</span>, for
        example &amp;gt;&amp;lt or <i>read()</i>)
        <span class="Li">&#34;print&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;write&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;seek&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;tell&#34;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&#34;eof&#34;</span> may cause confusion.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For WHENCE, you may also use the constants
        <span class="Li">&#34;SEEK_SET&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;SEEK_CUR&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;SEEK_END&#34;</span> (start of the file, current
        position, end of the file) from the Fcntl module. Use of the constants
        is also more portable than relying on 0, 1, and 2. For example to define
        a &#34;systell&#34; function:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        use Fcntl &#39;SEEK_CUR&#39;;
        sub systell { sysseek($_[0], 0, SEEK_CUR) }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Returns the new position, or the undefined value on failure. A
        position of zero is returned as the string <span class="Li">&#34;0 but
        true&#34;</span>; thus <span class="Li">&#34;sysseek&#34;</span>
        returns true on success and false on failure, yet you can still easily
        determine the new position.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>system LIST</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>system PROGRAM LIST</dt>
  <dd>Does exactly the same thing as <span class="Li">&#34;exec
      LIST&#34;</span>, except that a fork is done first, and the parent
      process waits for the child process to complete. Note that argument
      processing varies depending on the number of arguments. If there is more
      than one argument in LIST, or if LIST is an array with more than one
      value, starts the program given by the first element of the list with
      arguments given by the rest of the list. If there is only one scalar
      argument, the argument is checked for shell metacharacters, and if there
      are any, the entire argument is passed to the system&#39;s command shell for
      parsing (this is <span class="Li">&#34;/bin/sh -c&#34;</span> on Unix
      platforms, but varies on other platforms). If there are no shell
      metacharacters in the argument, it is split into words and passed directly
      to <span class="Li">&#34;execvp&#34;</span>, which is more efficient.
    <p class="Pp">Beginning with v5.6.0, Perl will attempt to flush all files
        opened for output before any operation that may do a fork, but this may
        not be supported on some platforms (see perlport). To be safe, you may
        need to set <span class="Li">$⎪</span> ($AUTOFLUSH in English) or
        call the <span class="Li">&#34;autoflush()&#34;</span> method of
        <span class="Li">&#34;IO::Handle&#34;</span> on any open handles.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The return value is the exit status of the program as returned
        by the <span class="Li">&#34;wait&#34;</span> call. To get the actual
        exit value shift right by eight (see below). See also &#34;exec&#34;.
        This is <i>not</i> what you want to use to capture the output from a
        command, for that you should use merely backticks or
        <span class="Li">&#34;qx//&#34;</span>, as described in
        &#34;`STRING`&#34; in perlop. Return value of -1 indicates a failure
        to start the program (inspect $! for the reason).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Like <span class="Li">&#34;exec&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;system&#34;</span> allows you to lie to a
        program about its name if you use the <span class="Li">&#34;system
        PROGRAM LIST&#34;</span> syntax. Again, see &#34;exec&#34;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&#34;system&#34;</span> and
        backticks block <span class="Li">&#34;SIGINT&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;SIGQUIT&#34;</span>, killing the program they&#39;re
        running doesn&#39;t actually interrupt your program.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @args = (&#34;command&#34;, &#34;arg1&#34;, &#34;arg2&#34;);
    system(@args) == 0
         or die &#34;system @args failed: $?&#34;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can check all the failure possibilities by inspecting
        <span class="Li">$?</span> like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if ($? == -1) {
        print &#34;failed to execute: $!\n&#34;;
    }
    elsif ($? &amp; 127) {
        printf &#34;child died with signal %d, %s coredump\n&#34;,
            ($? &amp; 127),  ($? &amp; 128) ? &#39;with&#39; : &#39;without&#39;;
    }
    else {
        printf &#34;child exited with value %d\n&#34;, $? &gt;&gt; 8;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or more portably by using the W*() calls of the POSIX
        extension; see perlport for more information.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the arguments get executed via the system shell, results
        and return codes will be subject to its quirks and capabilities. See
        &#34;`STRING`&#34; in perlop and &#34;exec&#34; for details.</p>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt>syswrite FILEHANDLE,SCALAR,LENGTH</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>syswrite FILEHANDLE,SCALAR</dt>
  <dd>Attempts to write LENGTH bytes of data from variable SCALAR to the
      specified FILEHANDLE, using the system call <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/write.2.zh_CN.html">write(2)</a>. If LENGTH is
      not specified, writes whole SCALAR. It bypasses buffered IO, so mixing
      this with reads (other than <span class="Li">sysread())</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;print&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;write&#34;</span>,

      <span class="Li">&#34;tell&#34;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&#34;eof&#34;</span> may cause confusion because the
      perlio and stdio layers usually buffers data. Returns the number of bytes
      actually written, or <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span> if there
      was an error (in this case the errno variable <span class="Li">$!</span>
      is also set). If the LENGTH is greater than the available data in the
      SCALAR after the OFFSET, only as much data as is available will be
      written.
    <p class="Pp">An OFFSET may be specified to write the data from some part of
        the string other than the beginning. A negative OFFSET specifies writing
        that many characters counting backwards from the end of the string. In
        the case the SCALAR is empty you can use OFFSET but only zero
      offset.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if the filehandle has been marked as
        <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span>, Unicode characters are
        written instead of bytes (the LENGTH, OFFSET, and the return value of
        <i>syswrite()</i> are in UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters). The
        <span class="Li">&#34;:encoding(...)&#34;</span> layer implicitly
        introduces the <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span> layer. See

  </dd>
  <dt>tell FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>tell</dt>
  <dd>Returns the current position <i>in bytes</i> for FILEHANDLE, or -1 on
      error. FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the name of the
      actual filehandle. If FILEHANDLE is omitted, assumes the file last read.
    <p class="Pp">Note the <i>in bytes</i>: even if the filehandle has been set
        to operate on characters (for example by using the
        <span class="Li">&#34;:utf8&#34;</span> open layer), <i>tell()</i>
        will return byte offsets, not character offsets (because that would
        render <i>seek()</i> and <i>tell()</i> rather slow).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The return value of <i>tell()</i> for the standard streams
        like the STDIN depends on the operating system: it may return -1 or
        something else. <i>tell()</i> on pipes, fifos, and sockets usually
        returns -1.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no <span class="Li">&#34;systell&#34;</span>
        function. Use <span class="Li">&#34;sysseek(FH, 0, 1)&#34;</span> for
        that.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Do not use <i>tell()</i> on a filehandle that has been opened
        using <i>sysopen()</i>, use <i>sysseek()</i> for that as described
        above. Why? Because <i>sysopen()</i> creates unbuffered,
        &#34;raw&#34;, filehandles, while <i>open()</i> creates buffered
        filehandles. <i>sysseek()</i> make sense only on the first kind,
        <i>tell()</i> only makes sense on the second kind.</p>

  <dt>telldir DIRHANDLE</dt>
  <dd>Returns the current position of the

      may be given to <span class="Li">&#34;seekdir&#34;</span> to access a

      directory compaction as the corresponding system library routine.</dd>
  <dt>tie VARIABLE,CLASSNAME,LIST</dt>
  <dd>This function binds a variable to a package class that will provide the
      implementation for the variable. VARIABLE is the name of the variable to
      be enchanted. CLASSNAME is the name of a class implementing objects of
      correct type. Any additional arguments are passed to the
      <span class="Li">&#34;new&#34;</span> method of the class (meaning
      <span class="Li">&#34;TIESCALAR&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;TIEHANDLE&#34;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&#34;TIEARRAY&#34;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&#34;TIEHASH&#34;</span>). Typically these are
      arguments such as might be passed to the
      <span class="Li">&#34;dbm_open()&#34;</span> function of C. The object
      returned by the <span class="Li">&#34;new&#34;</span> method is also
      returned by the <span class="Li">&#34;tie&#34;</span> function, which
      would be useful if you want to access other methods in CLASSNAME.
    <p class="Pp">Note that functions such as
        <span class="Li">&#34;keys&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;values&#34;</span> may return huge lists when

  <dd>Returns the value of EXPR with the first character in uppercase (titlecase
      in Unicode). This is the internal function implementing the
      <span class="Li">&#34;\u&#34;</span> escape in double-quoted strings.
      Respects current LC_CTYPE locale if <span class="Li">&#34;use
      locale&#34;</span> in force. See perllocale and perlunicode for more
      details about locale and Unicode support.
    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is omitted, uses <span class="Li">$_</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>umask EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>umask</dt>
  <dd>Sets the umask for the process to EXPR and returns the previous value. If
      EXPR is omitted, merely returns the current umask.
    <p class="Pp">The Unix permission
        <span class="Li">&#34;rwxr-x---&#34;</span> is represented as three
        sets of three bits, or three octal digits: <span class="Li">0750</span>
        (the leading 0 indicates octal and isn&#39;t one of the digits). The
        <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span> value is such a number
        representing disabled permissions bits. The permission (or
        &#34;mode&#34;) values you pass
        <span class="Li">&#34;mkdir&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;sysopen&#34;</span> are modified by your umask,
        so even if you tell <span class="Li">&#34;sysopen&#34;</span> to
        create a file with permissions <span class="Li">0777</span>, if your
        umask is <span class="Li">0022</span> then the file will actually be
        created with permissions <span class="Li">0755</span>. If your
        <span class="Li">&#34;umask&#34;</span> were
        <span class="Li">0027</span> (group can&#39;t write; others can&#39;t read,
        write, or execute), then passing
        <span class="Li">&#34;sysopen&#34;</span> <span class="Li">0666</span>
        would create a file with mode <span class="Li">0640</span>
        (<span class="Li">&#34;0666 &amp;~</span>
        <span class="Li">027&#34;</span> is <span class="Li">0640</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here&#39;s some advice: supply a creation mode of
        <span class="Li">0666</span> for regular files (in
        <span class="Li">&#34;sysopen&#34;</span>) and one of
        <span class="Li">0777</span> for directories (in
        <span class="Li">&#34;mkdir&#34;</span>) and executable files. This
        gives users the freedom of choice: if they want protected files, they
        might choose process umasks of <span class="Li">022</span>,
        <span class="Li">027</span>, or even the particularly antisocial mask of
        <span class="Li">077</span>. Programs should rarely if ever make policy
        decisions better left to the user. The exception to this is when writing
        files that should be kept private: mail files, web browser cookies,
        <i>.rhosts</i> files, and so on.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/umask.2.en.html">umask(2)</a> is not implemented on your system and you
        are trying to restrict access for <i>yourself</i> (i.e., (EXPR &amp;
        0700) &gt; 0), produces a fatal error at run time. If <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/umask.2.en.html">umask(2)</a> is
        not implemented and you are not trying to restrict access for yourself,
        returns <span class="Li">&#34;undef&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Remember that a umask is a number, usually given in octal; it
        is <i>not</i> a string of octal digits. See also &#34;oct&#34;, if all
        you have is a string.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>undef EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>undef</dt>
  <dd>Undefines the value of EXPR, which must be an lvalue. Use only on a scalar
      value, an array (using <span class="Li">&#34;@&#34;</span>), a hash
      (using <span class="Li">&#34;%&#34;</span>), a subroutine (using
      <span class="Li">&#34;&amp;&#34;</span>), or a typeglob (using
      <span class="Li">&#34;*&#34;</span>). (Saying
      <span class="Li">&#34;undef $hash{$key}&#34;</span> will probably not do
      what you expect on most predefined variables or DBM list values, so don&#39;t
      do that; see delete.) Always returns the undefined value. You can omit the
      EXPR, in which case nothing is undefined, but you still get an undefined
      value that you could, for instance, return from a subroutine, assign to a
      variable or pass as a parameter. Examples:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    undef $foo;
    undef $bar{&#39;blurfl&#39;};      # Compare to: delete $bar{&#39;blurfl&#39;};
    undef @ary;
    undef %hash;
    undef &amp;mysub;
    undef *xyz;       # destroys $xyz, @xyz, %xyz, &amp;xyz, etc.
    return (wantarray ? (undef, $errmsg) : undef) if $they_blew_it;
    select undef, undef, undef, 0.25;
    ($a, $b, undef, $c) = &amp;foo;       # Ignore third value returned

  </dd>
  <dt>unpack TEMPLATE,EXPR</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&#34;unpack&#34;</span> does the reverse of
      <span class="Li">&#34;pack&#34;</span>: it takes a string and expands it
      out into a list of values. (In scalar context, it returns merely the first
      value produced.)
    <p class="Pp">The string is broken into chunks described by the TEMPLATE.
        Each chunk is converted separately to a value. Typically, either the
        string is a result of <span class="Li">&#34;pack&#34;</span>, or the
        bytes of the string represent a C structure of some kind.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The TEMPLATE has the same format as in the
        <span class="Li">&#34;pack&#34;</span> function. Here&#39;s a subroutine
        that does substring:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub substr {
        my($what,$where,$howmuch) = @_;
        unpack(&#34;x$where a$howmuch&#34;, $what);
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">and then there&#39;s</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub ordinal { unpack(&#34;c&#34;,$_[0]); } # same as ord()
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In addition to fields allowed in <i>pack()</i>, you may prefix
        a field with a %&lt;number&gt; to indicate that you want a
        &lt;number&gt;-bit checksum of the items instead of the items
        themselves. Default is a 16-bit checksum. Checksum is calculated by
        summing numeric values of expanded values (for string fields the sum of
        <span class="Li">&#34;ord($char)&#34;</span> is taken, for bit fields
        the sum of zeroes and ones).</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, the following computes the same number as the
        System V sum program:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $checksum = do {
        local $/;  # slurp!
        unpack(&#34;%32C*&#34;,&lt;&gt;) % 65535;
    };
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The following efficiently counts the number of set bits in a
        bit vector:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $setbits = unpack(&#34;%32b*&#34;, $selectmask);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&#34;p&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;P&#34;</span> formats should be used with care.
        Since Perl has no way of checking whether the value passed to
        <span class="Li">&#34;unpack()&#34;</span> corresponds to a valid
        memory location, passing a pointer value that&#39;s not known to be valid is
        likely to have disastrous consequences.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If there are more pack codes or if the repeat count of a field
        or a group is larger than what the remainder of the input string allows,
        the result is not well defined: in some cases, the repeat count is
        decreased, or <span class="Li">&#34;unpack()&#34;</span> will produce
        null strings or zeroes, or terminate with an error. If the input string
        is longer than one described by the TEMPLATE, the rest is ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &#34;pack&#34; for more examples and notes.</p>

  <dd>Imports some semantics into the current package from the named module,
      generally by aliasing certain subroutine or variable names into your

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    BEGIN { require Module; import Module LIST; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">except that Module <i>must</i> be a bareword.</p>
    <p class="Pp">VERSION may be either a numeric argument such as 5.006, which

        <span class="Li">$PERL_VERSION</span>. A fatal error is produced if
        VERSION is greater than the version of the current Perl interpreter;
        Perl will not attempt to parse the rest of the file. Compare with
        &#34;require&#34;, which can do a similar check at run time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specifying VERSION as a literal of the form v5.6.1 should
        generally be avoided, because it leads to misleading error messages
        under earlier versions of Perl which do not support this syntax. The
        equivalent numeric version should be used instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use v5.6.1;         # compile time version check
    use 5.6.1;          # ditto
    use 5.006_001;      # ditto; preferred for backwards compatibility
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is often useful if you need to check the current Perl
        version before <span class="Li">&#34;use&#34;</span>ing library
        modules that have changed in incompatible ways from older versions of
        Perl. (We try not to do this more than we have to.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&#34;BEGIN&#34;</span> forces the
        <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> to happen at compile time.
        The <span class="Li">&#34;require&#34;</span> makes sure the module is
        loaded into memory if it hasn&#39;t been yet. The
        <span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> is not a builtin--it&#39;s just
        an ordinary static method call into the
        <span class="Li">&#34;Module&#34;</span> package to tell the module to
        import the list of features back into the current package. The module
        can implement its <span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> method any
        way it likes, though most modules just choose to derive their
        <span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> method via inheritance from
        the <span class="Li">&#34;Exporter&#34;</span> class that is defined
        in the <span class="Li">&#34;Exporter&#34;</span> module. See
        Exporter. If no <span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> method can be
        found then the call is skipped.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you do not want to call the package&#39;s
        <span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> method (for instance, to stop
        your namespace from being altered), explicitly supply the empty
      list:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Module ();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That is exactly equivalent to</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    BEGIN { require Module }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the VERSION argument is present between Module and LIST,
        then the <span class="Li">&#34;use&#34;</span> will call the VERSION
        method in class Module with the given version as an argument. The
        default VERSION method, inherited from the UNIVERSAL class, croaks if
        the given version is larger than the value of the variable
        <span class="Li">$Module::VERSION</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Again, there is a distinction between omitting LIST
        (<span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> called with no arguments)
        and an explicit empty LIST <span class="Li">&#34;()&#34;</span>
        (<span class="Li">&#34;import&#34;</span> not called). Note that there
        is no comma after VERSION!</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because this is a wide-open interface, pragmas (compiler
        directives) are also implemented this way. Currently implemented pragmas
        are:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use constant;

    use subs     qw(afunc blurfl);
    use warnings qw(all);
    use sort     qw(stable _quicksort _mergesort);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Some of these pseudo-modules import semantics into the current
        block scope (like <span class="Li">&#34;strict&#34;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&#34;integer&#34;</span>, unlike ordinary modules,
        which import symbols into the current package (which are effective
        through the end of the file).</p>
    <p class="Pp">There&#39;s a corresponding <span class="Li">&#34;no&#34;</span>
        command that unimports meanings imported by
        <span class="Li">&#34;use&#34;</span>, i.e., it calls
        <span class="Li">&#34;unimport Module LIST&#34;</span> instead of

  <dt>utime LIST</dt>
  <dd>Changes the access and modification times on each file of a list of files.
      The first two elements of the list must be the NUMERICAL access and
      modification times, in that order. Returns the number of files
      successfully changed. The inode change time of each file is set to the
      current time. For example, this code has the same effect as the Unix
      <a href="../../buster/manpages-zh/touch.1.zh_CN.html">touch(1)</a> command when the files <i>already exist</i>.
    <p class="Pp"></p>

  <dt>values HASH</dt>
  <dd>Returns a list consisting of all the values of the named hash. (In a
      scalar context, returns the number of values.)
    <p class="Pp">The values are returned in an apparently random order. The

        <span class="Li">&#34;each&#34;</span> function would produce on the
        same (unmodified) hash. Since Perl 5.8.1 the ordering is different even
        between different runs of Perl for security reasons (see
        &#34;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&#34; in perlsec).</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a side effect, calling <i>values()</i> resets the HASH&#39;s
        internal iterator, see &#34;each&#34;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the values are not copied, which means modifying

        <span class="Li">&#34;sort&#34;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS</dt>
  <dd>Treats the string in EXPR as a bit vector made up of elements of width
      BITS, and returns the value of the element specified by OFFSET as an
      unsigned integer. BITS therefore specifies the number of bits that are
      reserved for each element in the bit vector. This must be a power of two
      from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).
    <p class="Pp">If BITS is 8, &#34;elements&#34; coincide with bytes of the
        input string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If BITS is 16 or more, bytes of the input string are grouped
        into chunks of size BITS/8, and each group is converted to a number as
        with <i>pack()</i>/<i>unpack()</i> with big-endian formats
        <span class="Li">&#34;n&#34;</span>/<span class="Li">&#34;N&#34;</span>
        (and analogously for BITS==64). See &#34;pack&#34; for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If bits is 4 or less, the string is broken into bytes, then
        the bits of each byte are broken into 8/BITS groups. Bits of a byte are
        numbered in a little-endian-ish way, as in <span class="Li">0x01</span>,
        <span class="Li">0x02</span>, <span class="Li">0x04</span>,
        <span class="Li">0x08</span>, <span class="Li">0x10</span>,
        <span class="Li">0x20</span>, <span class="Li">0x40</span>,
        <span class="Li">0x80</span>. For example, breaking the single input
        byte <span class="Li">&#34;chr(0x36)&#34;</span> into two groups gives
        a list <span class="Li">&#34;(0x6, 0x3)&#34;</span>; breaking it into
        4 groups gives <span class="Li">&#34;(0x2, 0x1, 0x3,
      0x0)&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&#34;vec&#34;</span> may also be assigned

    <pre>    vec($image, $max_x * $x + $y, 8) = 3;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the selected element is outside the string, the value 0 is
        returned. If an element off the end of the string is written to, Perl
        will first extend the string with sufficiently many zero bytes. It is an
        error to try to write off the beginning of the string (i.e. negative
        OFFSET).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The string should not contain any character with the value
        &gt; 255 (which can only happen if you&#39;re using UTF-8 encoding). If it
        does, it will be treated as something which is not UTF-8 encoded. When
        the <span class="Li">&#34;vec&#34;</span> was assigned to, other parts
        of your program will also no longer consider the string to be UTF-8
        encoded. In other words, if you do have such characters in your string,
        <i>vec()</i> will operate on the actual byte string, and not the
        conceptual character string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Strings created with <span class="Li">&#34;vec&#34;</span>
        can also be manipulated with the logical operators
        <span class="Li">&#34;⎪&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;&amp;&#34;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&#34;^&#34;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&#34;~&#34;</span>. These operators will assume a bit
        vector operation is desired when both operands are strings. See
        &#34;Bitwise String Operators&#34; in perlop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The following code will build up an ASCII string saying
        <span class="Li">&#39;PerlPerlPerl&#39;</span>. The comments show the string
        after each step. Note that this code works in the same way on big-endian

    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>wait</dt>
  <dd>Behaves like the <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/wait.2.en.html">wait(2)</a> system call on your system: it waits for a
      child process to terminate and returns the pid of the deceased process, or
      <span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span> if there are no child processes.
      The status is returned in <span class="Li">$?</span>. Note that a return
      value of <span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span> could mean that child
      processes are being automatically reaped, as described in perlipc.</dd>
  <dt>waitpid PID,FLAGS</dt>
  <dd>Waits for a particular child process to terminate and returns the pid of
      the deceased process, or <span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span> if there
      is no such child process. On some systems, a value of 0 indicates that
      there are processes still running. The status is returned in
      <span class="Li">$?</span>. If you say
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use POSIX &#34;:sys_wait_h&#34;;
    #...
    do {
        $kid = waitpid(-1, WNOHANG);
    } until $kid &gt; 0;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then you can do a non-blocking wait for all pending zombie
        processes. Non-blocking wait is available on machines supporting either
        the <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/waitpid.2.en.html">waitpid(2)</a> or <a href="../../buster/manpages-dev/wait4.2.en.html">wait4(2)</a> system calls. However, waiting
        for a particular pid with FLAGS of <span class="Li">0</span> is
        implemented everywhere. (Perl emulates the system call by remembering
        the status values of processes that have exited but have not been
        harvested by the Perl script yet.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that on some systems, a return value of
        <span class="Li">&#34;-1&#34;</span> could mean that child processes
        are being automatically reaped. See perlipc for details, and for other
        examples.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>wantarray</dt>
  <dd>Returns true if the context of the currently executing subroutine is
      looking for a list value. Returns false if the context is looking for a
      scalar. Returns the undefined value if the context is looking for no value
      (void context).
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    return unless defined wantarray;    # don&#39;t bother doing more
    my @a = complex_calculation();
    return wantarray ? @a : &#34;@a&#34;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This function should have been named <i>wantlist()</i>
        instead.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>warn LIST</dt>
  <dd>Produces a message on STDERR just like
      <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span>, but doesn&#39;t exit or throw an
      exception.
    <p class="Pp">If LIST is empty and <span class="Li">$@</span> already
        contains a value (typically from a previous eval) that value is used
        after appending <span class="Li">&#34;\t...caught&#34;</span> to
        <span class="Li">$@</span>. This is useful for staying almost, but not
        entirely similar to <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$@</span> is empty then the string
        <span class="Li">&#34;Warning: Something&#39;s wrong&#34;</span> is
      used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">No message is printed if there is a
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> handler installed. It is the
        handler&#39;s responsibility to deal with the message as it sees fit (like,
        for instance, converting it into a
        <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span>). Most handlers must therefore
        make arrangements to actually display the warnings that they are not
        prepared to deal with, by calling
        <span class="Li">&#34;warn&#34;</span> again in the handler. Note that
        this is quite safe and will not produce an endless loop, since
        <span class="Li">&#34;__WARN__&#34;</span> hooks are not called from
        inside one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You will find this behavior is slightly different from that of
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> handlers (which don&#39;t suppress the
        error text, but can instead call <span class="Li">&#34;die&#34;</span>
        again to change it).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using a <span class="Li">&#34;__WARN__&#34;</span> handler
        provides a powerful way to silence all warnings (even the so-called
        mandatory ones). An example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # wipe out *all* compile-time warnings
    BEGIN { $SIG{&#39;__WARN__&#39;} = sub { warn $_[0] if $DOWARN } }
    my $foo = 10;
    my $foo = 20;          # no warning about duplicate my $foo,
                           # but hey, you asked for it!
    # no compile-time or run-time warnings before here
    $DOWARN = 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # run-time warnings enabled after here
    warn &#34;\$foo is alive and $foo!&#34;;     # does show up
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See perlvar for details on setting
        <span class="Li">%SIG</span> entries, and for more examples. See the
        Carp module for other kinds of warnings using its <i>carp()</i> and
        <i>cluck()</i> functions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>write FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>write EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>write</dt>
  <dd>Writes a formatted record (possibly multi-line) to the specified
      FILEHANDLE, using the format associated with that file. By default the
      format for a file is the one having the same name as the filehandle, but
      the format for the current output channel (see the
      <span class="Li">&#34;select&#34;</span> function) may be set explicitly
      by assigning the name of the format to the <span class="Li">$~</span>
      variable.
    <p class="Pp">Top of form processing is handled automatically: if there is
        insufficient room on the current page for the formatted record, the page
        is advanced by writing a form feed, a special top-of-page format is used
        to format the new page header, and then the record is written. By
        default the top-of-page format is the name of the filehandle with
        &#34;_TOP&#34; appended, but it may be dynamically set to the format
        of your choice by assigning the name to the <span class="Li">$^</span>
        variable while the filehandle is selected. The number of lines remaining
        on the current page is in variable
        <span class="Li">&#34;$-&#34;</span>, which can be set to
        <span class="Li">0</span> to force a new page.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If FILEHANDLE is unspecified, output goes to the current
        default output channel, which starts out as STDOUT but may be changed by
        the <span class="Li">&#34;select&#34;</span> operator. If the
        FILEHANDLE is an EXPR, then the expression is evaluated and the
        resulting string is used to look up the name of the FILEHANDLE at run
        time. For more on formats, see perlform.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that write is <i>not</i> the opposite of
        <span class="Li">&#34;read&#34;</span>. Unfortunately.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>y///</dt>
  <dd>The transliteration operator. Same as
      <span class="Li">&#34;tr///&#34;</span>. See perlop.
